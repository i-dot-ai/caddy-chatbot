See advice for See advice for Northern\\nIreland, See advice for Scotland, See advice for Wales\\n\\nThese steps should help you save time, money and stress when you’re preparing\\nto get building work, renovations or repairs done on your home. They’ll also\\nhelp you avoid problems with builders, plumbers or other contractors - for\\nexample decorators and electricians.\\n\\n##  Step 1: Check if you need permission or approval\\n\\nYou may have to get more than one kind of permission or approval before you go\\nahead with work on your home.\\n\\nAlways check if you need:\\n\\n  * building regulations approval \\\\- you may need this even for small improvements, eg replacing windows or doors\\n\\n  * planning permission \\\\- you usually need this to build something new or make a major change, eg an extension\\n\\nYou don’t have to apply for building regulations approval yourself if you hire\\na contractor who is registered with a ‘competent person scheme’. These are\\nschemes that are approved by the government.\\n\\nIf you don’t use a contractor registered with a competent person scheme you’ll\\nhave to submit a building notice or a full plans application to the Building\\nControl Body. You also have to pay a fee for them to come and inspect the work\\nyou have carried out.\\n\\n### If you have to get approval or permission\\n\\nYou may need to hire a surveyor or architect to help you apply for building\\nregulations approval or planning permission.\\n\\n### If you’re in a conservation area\\n\\nYou must also check with your local council before doing work on your home if\\nit’s in a conservation area.\\n\\n### If you’re a leaseholder\\n\\nCheck your lease if you own the leasehold (not the freehold) on your home. You\\nmay have to get permission from the freeholder before work starts. If the\\nlease says you can’t make changes, you can still ask the freeholder for\\npermission. You may have to pay some costs.\\n\\nImportant\\n\\n#### Check if you can get work done\\n\\nIf you don’t get the permission or approval you need, you could be fined,\\nprosecuted or made to pay to put things right. You may also have to undo the\\nwork, eg remove a new extension.\\n\\n##  Step 2: How to find good builders or contractors\\n\\nRecommendations and references are good ways to find reliable contractors who\\ndo a good job.\\n\\nIf you can’t get personal recommendations from people you know, ask\\ncontractors for references. It’s best to get:\\n\\n  * 2 or 3 recent examples of similar work they’ve done\\n\\n  * contact details for the people they did the work for - it’s best to get in touch because written references aren’t always genuine\\n\\nRead more on how to find a trustworthy trader.\\n\\n#### If your contractors don’t give references\\n\\nAvoid contractors who won’t give references - it’s a sign they could be\\ndishonest.\\n\\n### Do the proper checks\\n\\nIt’s dangerous to use someone who doesn’t know what they’re doing, especially\\nfor anything involving gas or electrics.\\n\\nYou should use:\\n\\n  * a registered gas engineer for gas work, eg installing a boiler or cooker\\n\\n  * a registered electrician for electrical work, eg installing new lighting or rewiring\\n\\n  * someone in a competent person scheme for work that needs building regulations approval (unless you got approval yourself)\\n\\nYou should also check if the contractor is a member of an approved trader\\nscheme.\\n\\n#### Check what a contractor says\\n\\nIt’s good idea to check what a contractor or their website tells you -\\nespecially if they’ve knocked on your door or telephoned you to offer their\\nservices. For instance, you can:\\n\\n  * ask to see a business card or letterhead, or get full contact details, then ring the business to check it exists and the contractor works for them\\n\\n  * ask to see proof of qualifications - for example an NVQ in construction for builders or a card from the Construction Skills Certification Scheme (trade associations can tell you about qualifications for particular types of work)\\n\\n  * check if the contractor is a member of the trade association they say they are - you should find a list of members on the trade association’s website\\n\\n##### If you have been provided with just a mobile number\\n\\nBe wary if a contractor just gives a mobile number. They may be hard to\\ncontact if problems come up. Make sure you do all the checks above in case\\nthey’re unreliable or dishonest.\\n\\n#### Interview contractors in person before you hire them\\n\\nBefore you meet them, it’s a good idea to write down:\\n\\n  * a clear and detailed description of exactly what you want done\\n\\n  * a list of questions to help you get all the information you need to compare and choose between contractors\\n\\nMake sure you can communicate with them easily - this will help you sort out\\nany problems that come up later.\\n\\nWhen you meet them, write down what they say they’ll do - if you do hire them\\nit’ll be helpful to have a record of the job details from this conversation,\\nas well as the written contract you’ll get before they start the work.\\n\\nIf you’re not comfortable with a particular contractor don’t hire them. You\\ncan always find someone else to do the work.\\n\\n##  Step 3: Get quotes before you decide who to use\\n\\nA quote is a promise from the contractor to do the work at a fixed price.\\nDon’t rely on a verbal quote - get it in writing.\\n\\nSome contractors charge for quotes - ask about this first.\\n\\nTry to get written quotes from at least 3 different contractors before you\\ndecide on one. Comparing quotes will help you decide if you’re getting a fair\\nprice.\\n\\nAfter you say yes to a quote, it’s a binding agreement between you and the\\ncontractor, whether it’s written down or not. But having it in writing means\\nyou can check what you agreed and prove it if there’s a dispute later.\\n\\n##### Quotes and estimates\\n\\nMake sure you get a quote, not an estimate. A quote is a fixed price, so\\nyou'll know what you’re getting and how much it will cost. An estimate is just\\na rough guess, so you could end up paying more.\\n\\nThe contractor can’t charge you more than the price on their quote unless:\\n\\n  * you ask for extra work that’s not included in the quote\\n\\n  * they let you know they have to do extra work and you agree to pay more for it\\n\\n  * they made a genuine mistake when writing down or calculating the price - they have the legal right to charge you what it should have been\\n\\n##### If you think your contractor is being dishonest\\n\\nBe wary if a contractor won’t put a quote in writing. It’s a sign they could\\nbe unreliable.\\n\\nAlso be cautious if their price is a lot lower than other quotes you get. It\\ncould mean they don’t have the right skills or experience, or they’re not\\nbeing honest. It could also mean they’re not quoting for exactly the same\\nwork.\\n\\n### What a quote should include\\n\\nBe very clear about the work you want done - this will help you get the most\\naccurate price and prevent misunderstandings later.\\n\\nA quote should include:\\n\\n  * a fixed total price - not a daily rate\\n\\n  * a breakdown of all the work to be done and the materials needed\\n\\n  * separate costs for each material and part of the work\\n\\n  * how long the price is valid for\\n\\n  * if the price includes VAT\\n\\n  * when the price can go up, eg only if you agree to extra work\\n\\nIf you get a daily rate instead of a fixed total price there’s a risk the\\ncontractor could string out the work to get more money. Avoid this by getting\\nthem to put in writing:\\n\\n  * how many days the work will take\\n\\n  * how many hours of work counts as a day\\n\\n  * when they need your go-ahead to work more days\\n\\n#### Check if your contractor has the correct insurance\\n\\nBefore saying yes to a quote, you should check the contractor has the correct\\ninsurance in place and try to get a written contract.\\n\\n#### See a sample quote\\n\\nYou can download a PDF of a sample quote.\\n\\n##  Step 4: Check there’s insurance in place\\n\\n### Contractors’ insurance - what to check\\n\\nAsk to see insurance policies and check they don’t run out before the work\\nwill be finished. If it’s insurance they must have, they have to let you see\\nthe policy.\\n\\n#### Insurance it's good to have\\n\\n**Public liability insurance** \\\\- it's worth asking contractors if they have\\ninsurance to cover you and them if someone’s hurt or property is damaged (eg\\nyour home or your neighbour’s). If they don't have any, you might want to\\nthink about getting your own cover.\\n\\n**Employers’ liability insurance** \\\\- contractors who work through a company\\nare breaking the law if they don’t have this. It doesn’t matter if it’s their\\nown company or not. It covers you and the company if they’re hurt on the job.\\n\\nImportant\\n\\n##### If your contractor doesn’t have insurance\\n\\nIf a contractor doesn’t have the right insurance, and things go wrong or\\nsomeone’s hurt, you could be forced to pay to fix things, or go to court and\\npay damages and legal fees.\\n\\n#### Other insurance to check for\\n\\nOther types of insurance may be available, but it’s worth remembering the\\ncontractor has to carry out the work with reasonable care and skill. If they\\ndon’t, you can ask them to redo the work or refund some of the cost.\\n\\n**Contractors’ all-risk cover** \\\\- this covers the cost of replacing work\\nthat’s destroyed before it’s completed, and before your insurance covers it.\\n\\n**Insurance-backed warranties or guarantees** \\\\- you can buy one of these as\\npart of the cost of the work, if the contractor offers it. Check exactly\\nwhat’s covered before you decide to buy one - it should cover the cost of\\nfinishing or fixing the work if the contractor does a bad job or goes out of\\nbusiness.\\n\\n### Your insurance - what to check\\n\\nIf you have home or contents insurance, contact your insurer to check you'll\\nbe covered during the work. You may have to pay more for your insurance during\\nand after the work.\\n\\nYour insurer will probably want to know what contractor you’re using and what\\ninsurance they have. They might suggest that you take out joint insurance with\\nthe contractor.\\n\\n#### How to protect yourself and your home against damage or loss\\n\\nIf you don’t have home and contents insurance, it’s worth looking into getting\\nsome before the work starts. You might feel more secure knowing you have\\ninsurance in place in case of any damage or if anything goes missing.\\n\\n##  Step 5: Get a written contract\\n\\nAs soon as you give a contractor the go-ahead, you’ve made a contract with\\nthem, even if it’s not written down.\\n\\nAlways try to get a contract in writing before you give the go-ahead. If the\\ncontractor doesn’t do what you agreed, a written contract can help you get\\nwhat you paid for, or at least get some of your money back.\\n\\nIf the contractor gives you a contract, check if it covers everything you\\nagreed. If they don’t you can write your own.\\n\\n#### If your contractor won’t provide you with anything in writing\\n\\nBe wary of contractors who won’t put anything in writing - it’s a sign they\\ncould be dishonest.\\n\\n### Help writing your own contract\\n\\nWritten contracts don’t need to be in legal language - they just need to\\noutline:\\n\\n  * exactly what you’re paying for (they can refer back to the quote for this)\\n\\n  * everything you’ve agreed on, eg timings, tidying up, materials and payments\\n\\nIt can help to look at example contracts, or create a contract using a\\ntemplate - eg for:\\n\\n  * home repairs or maintenance - you can download a free contract template\\n\\n  * building work - you can download an example contract or buy a contract template\\n\\n### Timings\\n\\nMake sure the contract covers:\\n\\n  * start and finish dates\\n\\n  * if you’ve agreed on a daily rate, the number of days the work will take and how many working hours are in a day\\n\\n  * delays - why they might happen, and what the contractor will do about them\\n\\n### Tidying up\\n\\nMake sure the contract covers:\\n\\n  * how and when the contractors will remove rubbish and clear up after themselves\\n\\n  * who pays for delivery and collection of any skips\\n\\n### Materials, equipment and subcontractors\\n\\nMake sure the contract covers:\\n\\n  * who pays to buy or hire materials and equipment for things the contractor buys, how they’ll give you receipts and paperwork\\n\\n  * if and when they’ll use subcontractors\\n\\n### Payments\\n\\nMake sure the contract covers how and when you’ll pay. Aim to:\\n\\n  * pay by card not cash\\n\\n  * pay in stages\\n\\n  * avoid deposits or upfront payments\\n\\n  * get some protection for your money\\n\\n#### If your contractor only accepts cash\\n\\nAvoid contractors who only accept cash or want you to pay everything upfront -\\nit’s a sign they could be dishonest or unreliable.\\n\\n#### Paying by card not cash\\n\\nIf you pay by credit or debit card, you may be able to get your money back\\nthrough your bank if something goes wrong, eg the contractor doesn’t turn up\\nbut refuses to pay back your deposit.\\n\\nIf this happens, you can contact your bank and say you want to use the\\n‘chargeback’ scheme.\\n\\nIf you pay more than £100 by credit card, it may be easier to tell your bank\\nyou want to ‘make a section 75 claim’. It’s another way to get your money\\nback.\\n\\n#### Paying in stages\\n\\nThis is a good idea, particularly if it’s a big job, because it means problems\\ncan be put right before you make the final payment. Be clear about the point\\nin the work when payments are due.\\n\\n#### Avoiding deposits\\n\\nDon’t agree to pay everything up front, in case something goes wrong or the\\ncontractor doesn’t turn up.\\n\\nIf they ask for a deposit to pay for materials, offer to buy them yourself\\ninstead of paying a deposit - that way, at least you own the materials if\\nsomething goes wrong.\\n\\nIf the work will take a long time, you may not be able to avoid a deposit. Aim\\nto push it down as much as possible, and don’t agree to more than 25%.\\n\\nAlways get a receipt for a deposit, as well as receipts for any materials it\\ncovers.\\n\\n#### Getting protection\\n\\nYou can protect your deposit or staged payments until the work’s complete, eg\\nwith a:\\n\\n  * deposit protection scheme - your money will be stored in a secure account until you and the builder are happy with the work\\n\\n  * insurance-backed warranty or guarantee - you can buy one of these from some contractors to cover the cost of finishing or fixing work if they do a bad job or go out of business\\n\\n##### Minimum cooling off period\\n\\nYou may be able to cancel the contract if you change your mind within 14 days\\nof giving the go-ahead or signing a written contract. If you agreed the work\\ncould start within those 14 days you may have to pay for some or all of it.\\n\\n##  Step 6: Be prepared to deal with problems\\n\\nGet the contractor’s full contact details before work starts. If you know how\\nto get in touch, it’s easier to deal with any problems that come up.\\n\\nAs soon as something happens that you’re not happy with:\\n\\n  * ask the builder or contractor to put it right\\n\\n  * come to an agreement about how they’ll fix it, and ask them to put it in writing\\n\\n### Next steps\\n\\nIf a contractor does a bad job or doesn’t do what you agreed, you should be\\nentitled to get it fixed or get some money back.

If they don’t you can write your own.\\n\\n#### If your contractor won’t provide you with anything in writing\\n\\nBe wary of contractors who won’t put anything in writing - it’s a sign they\\ncould be dishonest.\\n\\n### Help writing your own contract\\n\\nWritten contracts don’t need to be in legal language - they just need to\\noutline:\\n\\n  * exactly what you’re paying for (they can refer back to the quote for this)\\n\\n  * everything you’ve agreed on, eg timings, tidying up, materials and payments\\n\\nIt can help to look at example contracts, or create a contract using a\\ntemplate - eg for:\\n\\n  * home repairs or maintenance - you can download a free contract template\\n\\n  * building work - you can download an example contract or buy a contract template\\n\\n### Timings\\n\\nMake sure the contract covers:\\n\\n  * start and finish dates\\n\\n  * if you’ve agreed on a daily rate, the number of days the work will take and how many working hours are in a day\\n\\n  * delays - why they might happen, and what the contractor will do about them\\n\\n### Tidying up\\n\\nMake sure the contract covers:\\n\\n  * how and when the contractors will remove rubbish and clear up after themselves\\n\\n  * who pays for delivery and collection of any skips\\n\\n### Materials, equipment and subcontractors\\n\\nMake sure the contract covers:\\n\\n  * who pays to buy or hire materials and equipment for things the contractor buys, how they’ll give you receipts and paperwork\\n\\n  * if and when they’ll use subcontractors\\n\\n### Payments\\n\\nMake sure the contract covers how and when you’ll pay. Aim to:\\n\\n  * pay by card not cash\\n\\n  * pay in stages\\n\\n  * avoid deposits or upfront payments\\n\\n  * get some protection for your money\\n\\n#### If your contractor only accepts cash\\n\\nAvoid contractors who only accept cash or want you to pay everything upfront -\\nit’s a sign they could be dishonest or unreliable.\\n\\n#### Paying by card not cash\\n\\nIf you pay by credit or debit card, you may be able to get your money back\\nthrough your bank if something goes wrong, eg the contractor doesn’t turn up\\nbut refuses to pay back your deposit.\\n\\nIf this happens, you can contact your bank and say you want to use the\\n‘chargeback’ scheme.\\n\\nIf you pay more than £100 by credit card, it may be easier to tell your bank\\nyou want to ‘make a section 75 claim’. It’s another way to get your money\\nback.\\n\\n#### Paying in stages\\n\\nThis is a good idea, particularly if it’s a big job, because it means problems\\ncan be put right before you make the final payment. Be clear about the point\\nin the work when payments are due.\\n\\n#### Avoiding deposits\\n\\nDon’t agree to pay everything up front, in case something goes wrong or the\\ncontractor doesn’t turn up.\\n\\nIf they ask for a deposit to pay for materials, offer to buy them yourself\\ninstead of paying a deposit - that way, at least you own the materials if\\nsomething goes wrong.\\n\\nIf the work will take a long time, you may not be able to avoid a deposit. Aim\\nto push it down as much as possible, and don’t agree to more than 25%.\\n\\nAlways get a receipt for a deposit, as well as receipts for any materials it\\ncovers.\\n\\n#### Getting protection\\n\\nYou can protect your deposit or staged payments until the work’s complete, eg\\nwith a:\\n\\n  * deposit protection scheme - your money will be stored in a secure account until you and the builder are happy with the work\\n\\n  * insurance-backed warranty or guarantee - you can buy one of these from some contractors to cover the cost of finishing or fixing work if they do a bad job or go out of business\\n\\n##### Minimum cooling off period\\n\\nYou may be able to cancel the contract if you change your mind within 14 days\\nof giving the go-ahead or signing a written contract. If you agreed the work\\ncould start within those 14 days you may have to pay for some or all of it.\\n\\n##  Step 6: Be prepared to deal with problems\\n\\nGet the contractor’s full contact details before work starts. If you know how\\nto get in touch, it’s easier to deal with any problems that come up.\\n\\nAs soon as something happens that you’re not happy with:\\n\\n  * ask the builder or contractor to put it right\\n\\n  * come to an agreement about how they’ll fix it, and ask them to put it in writing\\n\\n### Next steps\\n\\nIf a contractor does a bad job or doesn’t do what you agreed, you should be\\nentitled to get it fixed or get some money back.

See advice for See advice for Northern\\nIreland, See advice for Scotland, See advice for Wales\\n\\n##  Related content\\n\\n## Related content\\n\\n  * ###  Home improvements\\n\\n  * Problem with building work, decorating or home improvements\\n  * Cancelling building or decorating work\\n\\n## On this page\\n\\n  * Further help \\n\\nThese steps should help you save time, money and stress when you’re preparing\\nto get building work, renovations or repairs done on your home. They’ll also\\nhelp you avoid problems with builders, plumbers or other contractors - for\\nexample decorators and electricians.\\n\\n##  Step 1: Check if you need permission or approval\\n\\nYou may have to get more than one kind of permission or approval before you go\\nahead with work on your home.\\n\\nAlways check if you need:\\n\\n  * building regulations approval \\\\- you may need this even for small improvements, eg replacing windows or doors\\n\\n  * planning permission \\\\- you usually need this to build something new or make a major change, eg an extension\\n\\nYou don’t have to apply for building regulations approval yourself if you hire\\na contractor who is registered with a ‘competent person scheme’. These are\\nschemes that are approved by the government.\\n\\nIf you don’t use a contractor registered with a competent person scheme you’ll\\nhave to submit a building notice or a full plans application to the Building\\nControl Body. You also have to pay a fee for them to come and inspect the work\\nyou have carried out.\\n\\n### If you have to get approval or permission\\n\\nYou may need to hire a surveyor or architect to help you apply for building\\nregulations approval or planning permission.\\n\\n### If you’re in a conservation area\\n\\nYou must also check with your local council before doing work on your home if\\nit’s in a conservation area.\\n\\n### If you’re a leaseholder\\n\\nCheck your lease if you own the leasehold (not the freehold) on your home. You\\nmay have to get permission from the freeholder before work starts. If the\\nlease says you can’t make changes, you can still ask the freeholder for\\npermission. You may have to pay some costs.\\n\\nImportant\\n\\n#### Check if you can get work done\\n\\nIf you don’t get the permission or approval you need, you could be fined,\\nprosecuted or made to pay to put things right. You may also have to undo the\\nwork, eg remove a new extension.\\n\\n##  Step 2: How to find good builders or contractors\\n\\nRecommendations and references are good ways to find reliable contractors who\\ndo a good job.\\n\\nIf you can’t get personal recommendations from people you know, ask\\ncontractors for references. It’s best to get:\\n\\n  * 2 or 3 recent examples of similar work they’ve done\\n\\n  * contact details for the people they did the work for - it’s best to get in touch because written references aren’t always genuine\\n\\nRead more on how to find a trustworthy trader.\\n\\n#### If your contractors don’t give references\\n\\nAvoid contractors who won’t give references - it’s a sign they could be\\ndishonest.\\n\\n### Do the proper checks\\n\\nIt’s dangerous to use someone who doesn’t know what they’re doing, especially\\nfor anything involving gas or electrics.\\n\\nYou should use:\\n\\n  * a registered gas engineer for gas work, eg installing a boiler or cooker\\n\\n  * a registered electrician for electrical work, eg installing new lighting or rewiring\\n\\n  * someone in a competent person scheme for work that needs building regulations approval (unless you got approval yourself)\\n\\nYou should also check if the contractor is a member of an approved trader\\nscheme.\\n\\n#### Check what a contractor says\\n\\nIt’s good idea to check what a contractor or their website tells you -\\nespecially if they’ve knocked on your door or telephoned you to offer their\\nservices. For instance, you can:\\n\\n  * ask to see a business card or letterhead, or get full contact details, then ring the business to check it exists and the contractor works for them\\n\\n  * ask to see proof of qualifications - for example an NVQ in construction for builders or a card from the Construction Skills Certification Scheme (trade associations can tell you about qualifications for particular types of work)\\n\\n  * check if the contractor is a member of the trade association they say they are - you should find a list of members on the trade association’s website\\n\\n##### If you have been provided with just a mobile number\\n\\nBe wary if a contractor just gives a mobile number. They may be hard to\\ncontact if problems come up. Make sure you do all the checks above in case\\nthey’re unreliable or dishonest.\\n\\n#### Interview contractors in person before you hire them\\n\\nBefore you meet them, it’s a good idea to write down:\\n\\n  * a clear and detailed description of exactly what you want done\\n\\n  * a list of questions to help you get all the information you need to compare and choose between contractors\\n\\nMake sure you can communicate with them easily - this will help you sort out\\nany problems that come up later.\\n\\nWhen you meet them, write down what they say they’ll do - if you do hire them\\nit’ll be helpful to have a record of the job details from this conversation,\\nas well as the written contract you’ll get before they start the work.\\n\\nIf you’re not comfortable with a particular contractor don’t hire them. You\\ncan always find someone else to do the work.\\n\\n##  Step 3: Get quotes before you decide who to use\\n\\nA quote is a promise from the contractor to do the work at a fixed price.\\nDon’t rely on a verbal quote - get it in writing.\\n\\nSome contractors charge for quotes - ask about this first.\\n\\nTry to get written quotes from at least 3 different contractors before you\\ndecide on one. Comparing quotes will help you decide if you’re getting a fair\\nprice.\\n\\nAfter you say yes to a quote, it’s a binding agreement between you and the\\ncontractor, whether it’s written down or not. But having it in writing means\\nyou can check what you agreed and prove it if there’s a dispute later.\\n\\n##### Quotes and estimates\\n\\nMake sure you get a quote, not an estimate. A quote is a fixed price, so\\nyou'll know what you’re getting and how much it will cost. An estimate is just\\na rough guess, so you could end up paying more.\\n\\nThe contractor can’t charge you more than the price on their quote unless:\\n\\n  * you ask for extra work that’s not included in the quote\\n\\n  * they let you know they have to do extra work and you agree to pay more for it\\n\\n  * they made a genuine mistake when writing down or calculating the price - they have the legal right to charge you what it should have been\\n\\n##### If you think your contractor is being dishonest\\n\\nBe wary if a contractor won’t put a quote in writing. It’s a sign they could\\nbe unreliable.\\n\\nAlso be cautious if their price is a lot lower than other quotes you get. It\\ncould mean they don’t have the right skills or experience, or they’re not\\nbeing honest. It could also mean they’re not quoting for exactly the same\\nwork.\\n\\n### What a quote should include\\n\\nBe very clear about the work you want done - this will help you get the most\\naccurate price and prevent misunderstandings later.\\n\\nA quote should include:\\n\\n  * a fixed total price - not a daily rate\\n\\n  * a breakdown of all the work to be done and the materials needed\\n\\n  * separate costs for each material and part of the work\\n\\n  * how long the price is valid for\\n\\n  * if the price includes VAT\\n\\n  * when the price can go up, eg only if you agree to extra work\\n\\nIf you get a daily rate instead of a fixed total price there’s a risk the\\ncontractor could string out the work to get more money. Avoid this by getting\\nthem to put in writing:\\n\\n  * how many days the work will take\\n\\n  * how many hours of work counts as a day\\n\\n  * when they need your go-ahead to work more days\\n\\n#### Check if your contractor has the correct insurance\\n\\nBefore saying yes to a quote, you should check the contractor has the correct\\ninsurance in place and try to get a written contract.\\n\\n#### See a sample quote\\n\\nYou can download a PDF of a sample quote.\\n\\n##  Step 4: Check there’s insurance in place\\n\\n### Contractors’ insurance - what to check\\n\\nAsk to see insurance policies and check they don’t run out before the work\\nwill be finished. If it’s insurance they must have, they have to let you see\\nthe policy.\\n\\n#### Insurance it's good to have\\n\\n**Public liability insurance** \\\\- it's worth asking contractors if they have\\ninsurance to cover you and them if someone’s hurt or property is damaged (eg\\nyour home or your neighbour’s). If they don't have any, you might want to\\nthink about getting your own cover.\\n\\n**Employers’ liability insurance** \\\\- contractors who work through a company\\nare breaking the law if they don’t have this. It doesn’t matter if it’s their\\nown company or not. It covers you and the company if they’re hurt on the job.\\n\\nImportant\\n\\n##### If your contractor doesn’t have insurance\\n\\nIf a contractor doesn’t have the right insurance, and things go wrong or\\nsomeone’s hurt, you could be forced to pay to fix things, or go to court and\\npay damages and legal fees.\\n\\n#### Other insurance to check for\\n\\nOther types of insurance may be available, but it’s worth remembering the\\ncontractor has to carry out the work with reasonable care and skill. If they\\ndon’t, you can ask them to redo the work or refund some of the cost.\\n\\n**Contractors’ all-risk cover** \\\\- this covers the cost of replacing work\\nthat’s destroyed before it’s completed, and before your insurance covers it.\\n\\n**Insurance-backed warranties or guarantees** \\\\- you can buy one of these as\\npart of the cost of the work, if the contractor offers it. Check exactly\\nwhat’s covered before you decide to buy one - it should cover the cost of\\nfinishing or fixing the work if the contractor does a bad job or goes out of\\nbusiness.\\n\\n### Your insurance - what to check\\n\\nIf you have home or contents insurance, contact your insurer to check you'll\\nbe covered during the work. You may have to pay more for your insurance during\\nand after the work.\\n\\nYour insurer will probably want to know what contractor you’re using and what\\ninsurance they have. They might suggest that you take out joint insurance with\\nthe contractor.\\n\\n#### How to protect yourself and your home against damage or loss\\n\\nIf you don’t have home and contents insurance, it’s worth looking into getting\\nsome before the work starts. You might feel more secure knowing you have\\ninsurance in place in case of any damage or if anything goes missing.\\n\\n##  Step 5: Get a written contract\\n\\nAs soon as you give a contractor the go-ahead, you’ve made a contract with\\nthem, even if it’s not written down.\\n\\nAlways try to get a contract in writing before you give the go-ahead. If the\\ncontractor doesn’t do what you agreed, a written contract can help you get\\nwhat you paid for, or at least get some of your money back.\\n\\nIf the contractor gives you a contract, check if it covers everything you\\nagreed. If they don’t you can write your own.\\n\\n#### If your contractor won’t provide you with anything in writing\\n\\nBe wary of contractors who won’t put anything in writing - it’s a sign they\\ncould be dishonest.\\n\\n### Help writing your own contract\\n\\nWritten contracts don’t need to be in legal language - they just need to\\noutline:\\n\\n  * exactly what you’re paying for (they can refer back to the quote for this)\\n\\n  * everything you’ve agreed on, eg timings, tidying up, materials and payments\\n\\nIt can help to look at example contracts, or create a contract using a\\ntemplate - eg for:\\n\\n  * home repairs or maintenance - you can download a free contract template\\n\\n  * building work - you can download an example contract or buy a contract template\\n\\n### Timings\\n\\nMake sure the contract covers:\\n\\n  * start and finish dates\\n\\n  * if you’ve agreed on a daily rate, the number of days the work will take and how many working hours are in a day\\n\\n  * delays - why they might happen, and what the contractor will do about them\\n\\n### Tidying up\\n\\nMake sure the contract covers:\\n\\n  * how and when the contractors will remove rubbish and clear up after themselves\\n\\n  * who pays for delivery and collection of any skips\\n\\n### Materials, equipment and subcontractors\\n\\nMake sure the contract covers:\\n\\n  * who pays to buy or hire materials and equipment for things the contractor buys, how they’ll give you receipts and paperwork\\n\\n  * if and when they’ll use subcontractors\\n\\n### Payments\\n\\nMake sure the contract covers how and when you’ll pay. Aim to:\\n\\n  * pay by card not cash\\n\\n  * pay in stages\\n\\n  * avoid deposits or upfront payments\\n\\n  * get some protection for your money\\n\\n#### If your contractor only accepts cash\\n\\nAvoid contractors who only accept cash or want you to pay everything upfront -\\nit’s a sign they could be dishonest or unreliable.\\n\\n#### Paying by card not cash\\n\\nIf you pay by credit or debit card, you may be able to get your money back\\nthrough your bank if something goes wrong, eg the contractor doesn’t turn up\\nbut refuses to pay back your deposit.\\n\\nIf this happens, you can contact your bank and say you want to use the\\n‘chargeback’ scheme.\\n\\nIf you pay more than £100 by credit card, it may be easier to tell your bank\\nyou want to ‘make a section 75 claim’.

You can find out\\nmore or opt-out from some cookies.\\n\\nSkip to navigation Skip to main content Skip to footer\\n\\n  * Cymraeg\\n  * Sign in\\n\\nSearch\\n\\n  * Benefits\\n  * Work\\n  * Debt and money\\n  * Consumer\\n  * Housing\\n  * Family\\n  * Law and courts\\n  * Immigration\\n  * Health\\n  * More from us\\n\\n  * Home\\n  * Consumer\\n  * Home improvements\\n  * Before you get building work done\\n\\n#  Before you get building work done\\n\\nThis advice applies to England.  See advice for See advice for Northern\\nIreland, See advice for Scotland, See advice for Wales\\n\\nThese steps should help you save time, money and stress when you’re preparing\\nto get building work, renovations or repairs done on your home. They’ll also\\nhelp you avoid problems with builders, plumbers or other contractors - for\\nexample decorators and electricians.\\n\\n##  Step 1: Check if you need permission or approval\\n\\nYou may have to get more than one kind of permission or approval before you go\\nahead with work on your home.\\n\\nAlways check if you need:\\n\\n  * building regulations approval \\\\- you may need this even for small improvements, eg replacing windows or doors\\n\\n  * planning permission \\\\- you usually need this to build something new or make a major change, eg an extension\\n\\nYou don’t have to apply for building regulations approval yourself if you hire\\na contractor who is registered with a ‘competent person scheme’. These are\\nschemes that are approved by the government.\\n\\nIf you don’t use a contractor registered with a competent person scheme you’ll\\nhave to submit a building notice or a full plans application to the Building\\nControl Body. You also have to pay a fee for them to come and inspect the work\\nyou have carried out.\\n\\n### If you have to get approval or permission\\n\\nYou may need to hire a surveyor or architect to help you apply for building\\nregulations approval or planning permission.\\n\\n### If you’re in a conservation area\\n\\nYou must also check with your local council before doing work on your home if\\nit’s in a conservation area.\\n\\n### If you’re a leaseholder\\n\\nCheck your lease if you own the leasehold (not the freehold) on your home. You\\nmay have to get permission from the freeholder before work starts. If the\\nlease says you can’t make changes, you can still ask the freeholder for\\npermission. You may have to pay some costs.\\n\\nImportant\\n\\n#### Check if you can get work done\\n\\nIf you don’t get the permission or approval you need, you could be fined,\\nprosecuted or made to pay to put things right. You may also have to undo the\\nwork, eg remove a new extension.\\n\\n##  Step 2: How to find good builders or contractors\\n\\nRecommendations and references are good ways to find reliable contractors who\\ndo a good job.\\n\\nIf you can’t get personal recommendations from people you know, ask\\ncontractors for references. It’s best to get:\\n\\n  * 2 or 3 recent examples of similar work they’ve done\\n\\n  * contact details for the people they did the work for - it’s best to get in touch because written references aren’t always genuine\\n\\nRead more on how to find a trustworthy trader.\\n\\n#### If your contractors don’t give references\\n\\nAvoid contractors who won’t give references - it’s a sign they could be\\ndishonest.\\n\\n### Do the proper checks\\n\\nIt’s dangerous to use someone who doesn’t know what they’re doing, especially\\nfor anything involving gas or electrics.\\n\\nYou should use:\\n\\n  * a registered gas engineer for gas work, eg installing a boiler or cooker\\n\\n  * a registered electrician for electrical work, eg installing new lighting or rewiring\\n\\n  * someone in a competent person scheme for work that needs building regulations approval (unless you got approval yourself)\\n\\nYou should also check if the contractor is a member of an approved trader\\nscheme.\\n\\n#### Check what a contractor says\\n\\nIt’s good idea to check what a contractor or their website tells you -\\nespecially if they’ve knocked on your door or telephoned you to offer their\\nservices. For instance, you can:\\n\\n  * ask to see a business card or letterhead, or get full contact details, then ring the business to check it exists and the contractor works for them\\n\\n  * ask to see proof of qualifications - for example an NVQ in construction for builders or a card from the Construction Skills Certification Scheme (trade associations can tell you about qualifications for particular types of work)\\n\\n  * check if the contractor is a member of the trade association they say they are - you should find a list of members on the trade association’s website\\n\\n##### If you have been provided with just a mobile number\\n\\nBe wary if a contractor just gives a mobile number. They may be hard to\\ncontact if problems come up. Make sure you do all the checks above in case\\nthey’re unreliable or dishonest.\\n\\n#### Interview contractors in person before you hire them\\n\\nBefore you meet them, it’s a good idea to write down:\\n\\n  * a clear and detailed description of exactly what you want done\\n\\n  * a list of questions to help you get all the information you need to compare and choose between contractors\\n\\nMake sure you can communicate with them easily - this will help you sort out\\nany problems that come up later.\\n\\nWhen you meet them, write down what they say they’ll do - if you do hire them\\nit’ll be helpful to have a record of the job details from this conversation,\\nas well as the written contract you’ll get before they start the work.\\n\\nIf you’re not comfortable with a particular contractor don’t hire them. You\\ncan always find someone else to do the work.\\n\\n##  Step 3: Get quotes before you decide who to use\\n\\nA quote is a promise from the contractor to do the work at a fixed price.\\nDon’t rely on a verbal quote - get it in writing.\\n\\nSome contractors charge for quotes - ask about this first.\\n\\nTry to get written quotes from at least 3 different contractors before you\\ndecide on one. Comparing quotes will help you decide if you’re getting a fair\\nprice.\\n\\nAfter you say yes to a quote, it’s a binding agreement between you and the\\ncontractor, whether it’s written down or not. But having it in writing means\\nyou can check what you agreed and prove it if there’s a dispute later.\\n\\n##### Quotes and estimates\\n\\nMake sure you get a quote, not an estimate. A quote is a fixed price, so\\nyou'll know what you’re getting and how much it will cost. An estimate is just\\na rough guess, so you could end up paying more.\\n\\nThe contractor can’t charge you more than the price on their quote unless:\\n\\n  * you ask for extra work that’s not included in the quote\\n\\n  * they let you know they have to do extra work and you agree to pay more for it\\n\\n  * they made a genuine mistake when writing down or calculating the price - they have the legal right to charge you what it should have been\\n\\n##### If you think your contractor is being dishonest\\n\\nBe wary if a contractor won’t put a quote in writing. It’s a sign they could\\nbe unreliable.\\n\\nAlso be cautious if their price is a lot lower than other quotes you get. It\\ncould mean they don’t have the right skills or experience, or they’re not\\nbeing honest. It could also mean they’re not quoting for exactly the same\\nwork.\\n\\n### What a quote should include\\n\\nBe very clear about the work you want done - this will help you get the most\\naccurate price and prevent misunderstandings later.\\n\\nA quote should include:\\n\\n  * a fixed total price - not a daily rate\\n\\n  * a breakdown of all the work to be done and the materials needed\\n\\n  * separate costs for each material and part of the work\\n\\n  * how long the price is valid for\\n\\n  * if the price includes VAT\\n\\n  * when the price can go up, eg only if you agree to extra work\\n\\nIf you get a daily rate instead of a fixed total price there’s a risk the\\ncontractor could string out the work to get more money. Avoid this by getting\\nthem to put in writing:\\n\\n  * how many days the work will take\\n\\n  * how many hours of work counts as a day\\n\\n  * when they need your go-ahead to work more days\\n\\n#### Check if your contractor has the correct insurance\\n\\nBefore saying yes to a quote, you should check the contractor has the correct\\ninsurance in place and try to get a written contract.\\n\\n#### See a sample quote\\n\\nYou can download a PDF of a sample quote.\\n\\n##  Step 4: Check there’s insurance in place\\n\\n### Contractors’ insurance - what to check\\n\\nAsk to see insurance policies and check they don’t run out before the work\\nwill be finished. If it’s insurance they must have, they have to let you see\\nthe policy.\\n\\n#### Insurance it's good to have\\n\\n**Public liability insurance** \\\\- it's worth asking contractors if they have\\ninsurance to cover you and them if someone’s hurt or property is damaged (eg\\nyour home or your neighbour’s). If they don't have any, you might want to\\nthink about getting your own cover.\\n\\n**Employers’ liability insurance** \\\\- contractors who work through a company\\nare breaking the law if they don’t have this. It doesn’t matter if it’s their\\nown company or not. It covers you and the company if they’re hurt on the job.\\n\\nImportant\\n\\n##### If your contractor doesn’t have insurance\\n\\nIf a contractor doesn’t have the right insurance, and things go wrong or\\nsomeone’s hurt, you could be forced to pay to fix things, or go to court and\\npay damages and legal fees.\\n\\n#### Other insurance to check for\\n\\nOther types of insurance may be available, but it’s worth remembering the\\ncontractor has to carry out the work with reasonable care and skill. If they\\ndon’t, you can ask them to redo the work or refund some of the cost.\\n\\n**Contractors’ all-risk cover** \\\\- this covers the cost of replacing work\\nthat’s destroyed before it’s completed, and before your insurance covers it.\\n\\n**Insurance-backed warranties or guarantees** \\\\- you can buy one of these as\\npart of the cost of the work, if the contractor offers it. Check exactly\\nwhat’s covered before you decide to buy one - it should cover the cost of\\nfinishing or fixing the work if the contractor does a bad job or goes out of\\nbusiness.\\n\\n### Your insurance - what to check\\n\\nIf you have home or contents insurance, contact your insurer to check you'll\\nbe covered during the work. You may have to pay more for your insurance during\\nand after the work.\\n\\nYour insurer will probably want to know what contractor you’re using and what\\ninsurance they have. They might suggest that you take out joint insurance with\\nthe contractor.\\n\\n#### How to protect yourself and your home against damage or loss\\n\\nIf you don’t have home and contents insurance, it’s worth looking into getting\\nsome before the work starts. You might feel more secure knowing you have\\ninsurance in place in case of any damage or if anything goes missing.\\n\\n##  Step 5: Get a written contract\\n\\nAs soon as you give a contractor the go-ahead, you’ve made a contract with\\nthem, even if it’s not written down.\\n\\nAlways try to get a contract in writing before you give the go-ahead. If the\\ncontractor doesn’t do what you agreed, a written contract can help you get\\nwhat you paid for, or at least get some of your money back.\\n\\nIf the contractor gives you a contract, check if it covers everything you\\nagreed. If they don’t you can write your own.\\n\\n#### If your contractor won’t provide you with anything in writing\\n\\nBe wary of contractors who won’t put anything in writing - it’s a sign they\\ncould be dishonest.\\n\\n### Help writing your own contract\\n\\nWritten contracts don’t need to be in legal language - they just need to\\noutline:\\n\\n  * exactly what you’re paying for (they can refer back to the quote for this)\\n\\n  * everything you’ve agreed on, eg timings, tidying up, materials and payments\\n\\nIt can help to look at example contracts, or create a contract using a\\ntemplate - eg for:\\n\\n  * home repairs or maintenance - you can download a free contract template\\n\\n  * building work - you can download an example contract or buy a contract template\\n\\n### Timings\\n\\nMake sure the contract covers:\\n\\n  * start and finish dates\\n\\n  * if you’ve agreed on a daily rate, the number of days the work will take and how many working hours are in a day\\n\\n  * delays - why they might happen, and what the contractor will do about them\\n\\n### Tidying up\\n\\nMake sure the contract covers:\\n\\n  * how and when the contractors will remove rubbish and clear up after themselves\\n\\n  * who pays for delivery and collection of any skips\\n\\n### Materials, equipment and subcontractors\\n\\nMake sure the contract covers:\\n\\n  * who pays to buy or hire materials and equipment for things the contractor buys, how they’ll give you receipts and paperwork\\n\\n  * if and when they’ll use subcontractors\\n\\n### Payments\\n\\nMake sure the contract covers how and when you’ll pay. Aim to:\\n\\n  * pay by card not cash\\n\\n  * pay in stages\\n\\n  * avoid deposits or upfront payments\\n\\n  * get some protection for your money\\n\\n#### If your contractor only accepts cash\\n\\nAvoid contractors who only accept cash or want you to pay everything upfront -\\nit’s a sign they could be dishonest or unreliable.\\n\\n#### Paying by card not cash\\n\\nIf you pay by credit or debit card, you may be able to get your money back\\nthrough your bank if something goes wrong, eg the contractor doesn’t turn up\\nbut refuses to pay back your deposit.\\n\\nIf this happens, you can contact your bank and say you want to use the\\n‘chargeback’ scheme.\\n\\nIf you pay more than £100 by credit card, it may be easier to tell your bank\\nyou want to ‘make a section 75 claim’. It’s another way to get your money\\nback.\\n\\n#### Paying in stages\\n\\nThis is a good idea, particularly if it’s a big job, because it means problems\\ncan be put right before you make the final payment. Be clear about the point\\nin the work when payments are due.\\n\\n#### Avoiding deposits\\n\\nDon’t agree to pay everything up front, in case something goes wrong or the\\ncontractor doesn’t turn up.\\n\\nIf they ask for a deposit to pay for materials, offer to buy them yourself\\ninstead of paying a deposit - that way, at least you own the materials if\\nsomething goes wrong.\\n\\nIf the work will take a long time, you may not be able to avoid a deposit. Aim\\nto push it down as much as possible, and don’t agree to more than 25%.\\n\\nAlways get a receipt for a deposit, as well as receipts for any materials it\\ncovers.\\n\\n#### Getting protection\\n\\nYou can protect your deposit or staged payments until the work’s complete, eg\\nwith a:\\n\\n  * deposit protection scheme - your money will be stored in a secure account until you and the builder are happy with the work\\n\\n  * insurance-backed warranty or guarantee - you can buy one of these from some contractors to cover the cost of finishing or fixing work if they do a bad job or go out of business\\n\\n##### Minimum cooling off period\\n\\nYou may be able to cancel the contract if you change your mind within 14 days\\nof giving the go-ahead or signing a written contract. If you agreed the work\\ncould start within those 14 days you may have to pay for some or all of it.\\n\\n##  Step 6: Be prepared to deal with problems\\n\\nGet the contractor’s full contact details before work starts. If you know how\\nto get in touch, it’s easier to deal with any problems that come up.\\n\\nAs soon as something happens that you’re not happy with:\\n\\n  * ask the builder or contractor to put it right\\n\\n  * come to an agreement about how they’ll fix it, and ask them to put it in writing\\n\\n### Next steps\\n\\nIf a contractor does a bad job or doesn’t do what you agreed, you should be\\nentitled to get it fixed or get some money back.

If they don’t you can write your own.\\n\\n#### If your contractor won’t provide you with anything in writing\\n\\nBe wary of contractors who won’t put anything in writing - it’s a sign they\\ncould be dishonest.\\n\\n### Help writing your own contract\\n\\nWritten contracts don’t need to be in legal language - they just need to\\noutline:\\n\\n  * exactly what you’re paying for (they can refer back to the quote for this)\\n\\n  * everything you’ve agreed on, eg timings, tidying up, materials and payments\\n\\nIt can help to look at example contracts, or create a contract using a\\ntemplate - eg for:\\n\\n  * home repairs or maintenance - you can download a free contract template\\n\\n  * building work - you can download an example contract or buy a contract template\\n\\n### Timings\\n\\nMake sure the contract covers:\\n\\n  * start and finish dates\\n\\n  * if you’ve agreed on a daily rate, the number of days the work will take and how many working hours are in a day\\n\\n  * delays - why they might happen, and what the contractor will do about them\\n\\n### Tidying up\\n\\nMake sure the contract covers:\\n\\n  * how and when the contractors will remove rubbish and clear up after themselves\\n\\n  * who pays for delivery and collection of any skips\\n\\n### Materials, equipment and subcontractors\\n\\nMake sure the contract covers:\\n\\n  * who pays to buy or hire materials and equipment for things the contractor buys, how they’ll give you receipts and paperwork\\n\\n  * if and when they’ll use subcontractors\\n\\n### Payments\\n\\nMake sure the contract covers how and when you’ll pay. Aim to:\\n\\n  * pay by card not cash\\n\\n  * pay in stages\\n\\n  * avoid deposits or upfront payments\\n\\n  * get some protection for your money\\n\\n#### If your contractor only accepts cash\\n\\nAvoid contractors who only accept cash or want you to pay everything upfront -\\nit’s a sign they could be dishonest or unreliable.\\n\\n#### Paying by card not cash\\n\\nIf you pay by credit or debit card, you may be able to get your money back\\nthrough your bank if something goes wrong, eg the contractor doesn’t turn up\\nbut refuses to pay back your deposit.\\n\\nIf this happens, you can contact your bank and say you want to use the\\n‘chargeback’ scheme.\\n\\nIf you pay more than £100 by credit card, it may be easier to tell your bank\\nyou want to ‘make a section 75 claim’. It’s another way to get your money\\nback.\\n\\n#### Paying in stages\\n\\nThis is a good idea, particularly if it’s a big job, because it means problems\\ncan be put right before you make the final payment. Be clear about the point\\nin the work when payments are due.\\n\\n#### Avoiding deposits\\n\\nDon’t agree to pay everything up front, in case something goes wrong or the\\ncontractor doesn’t turn up.\\n\\nIf they ask for a deposit to pay for materials, offer to buy them yourself\\ninstead of paying a deposit - that way, at least you own the materials if\\nsomething goes wrong.\\n\\nIf the work will take a long time, you may not be able to avoid a deposit. Aim\\nto push it down as much as possible, and don’t agree to more than 25%.\\n\\nAlways get a receipt for a deposit, as well as receipts for any materials it\\ncovers.\\n\\n#### Getting protection\\n\\nYou can protect your deposit or staged payments until the work’s complete, eg\\nwith a:\\n\\n  * deposit protection scheme - your money will be stored in a secure account until you and the builder are happy with the work\\n\\n  * insurance-backed warranty or guarantee - you can buy one of these from some contractors to cover the cost of finishing or fixing work if they do a bad job or go out of business\\n\\n##### Minimum cooling off period\\n\\nYou may be able to cancel the contract if you change your mind within 14 days\\nof giving the go-ahead or signing a written contract. If you agreed the work\\ncould start within those 14 days you may have to pay for some or all of it.\\n\\n##  Step 6: Be prepared to deal with problems\\n\\nGet the contractor’s full contact details before work starts. If you know how\\nto get in touch, it’s easier to deal with any problems that come up.\\n\\nAs soon as something happens that you’re not happy with:\\n\\n  * ask the builder or contractor to put it right\\n\\n  * come to an agreement about how they’ll fix it, and ask them to put it in writing\\n\\n### Next steps\\n\\nIf a contractor does a bad job or doesn’t do what you agreed, you should be\\nentitled to get it fixed or get some money back.

See advice for See advice for Northern\\nIreland, See advice for Scotland, See advice for Wales\\n\\n##  Related content\\n\\n## Related content\\n\\n  * ###  Home improvements\\n\\n  * Problem with building work, decorating or home improvements\\n  * Cancelling building or decorating work\\n\\n## On this page\\n\\n  * Further help \\n\\nThese steps should help you save time, money and stress when you’re preparing\\nto get building work, renovations or repairs done on your home. They’ll also\\nhelp you avoid problems with builders, plumbers or other contractors - for\\nexample decorators and electricians.\\n\\n##  Step 1: Check if you need permission or approval\\n\\nYou may have to get more than one kind of permission or approval before you go\\nahead with work on your home.\\n\\nAlways check if you need:\\n\\n  * building regulations approval \\\\- you may need this even for small improvements, eg replacing windows or doors\\n\\n  * planning permission \\\\- you usually need this to build something new or make a major change, eg an extension\\n\\nYou don’t have to apply for building regulations approval yourself if you hire\\na contractor who is registered with a ‘competent person scheme’. These are\\nschemes that are approved by the government.\\n\\nIf you don’t use a contractor registered with a competent person scheme you’ll\\nhave to submit a building notice or a full plans application to the Building\\nControl Body. You also have to pay a fee for them to come and inspect the work\\nyou have carried out.\\n\\n### If you have to get approval or permission\\n\\nYou may need to hire a surveyor or architect to help you apply for building\\nregulations approval or planning permission.\\n\\n### If you’re in a conservation area\\n\\nYou must also check with your local council before doing work on your home if\\nit’s in a conservation area.\\n\\n### If you’re a leaseholder\\n\\nCheck your lease if you own the leasehold (not the freehold) on your home. You\\nmay have to get permission from the freeholder before work starts. If the\\nlease says you can’t make changes, you can still ask the freeholder for\\npermission. You may have to pay some costs.\\n\\nImportant\\n\\n#### Check if you can get work done\\n\\nIf you don’t get the permission or approval you need, you could be fined,\\nprosecuted or made to pay to put things right. You may also have to undo the\\nwork, eg remove a new extension.\\n\\n##  Step 2: How to find good builders or contractors\\n\\nRecommendations and references are good ways to find reliable contractors who\\ndo a good job.\\n\\nIf you can’t get personal recommendations from people you know, ask\\ncontractors for references. It’s best to get:\\n\\n  * 2 or 3 recent examples of similar work they’ve done\\n\\n  * contact details for the people they did the work for - it’s best to get in touch because written references aren’t always genuine\\n\\nRead more on how to find a trustworthy trader.\\n\\n#### If your contractors don’t give references\\n\\nAvoid contractors who won’t give references - it’s a sign they could be\\ndishonest.\\n\\n### Do the proper checks\\n\\nIt’s dangerous to use someone who doesn’t know what they’re doing, especially\\nfor anything involving gas or electrics.\\n\\nYou should use:\\n\\n  * a registered gas engineer for gas work, eg installing a boiler or cooker\\n\\n  * a registered electrician for electrical work, eg installing new lighting or rewiring\\n\\n  * someone in a competent person scheme for work that needs building regulations approval (unless you got approval yourself)\\n\\nYou should also check if the contractor is a member of an approved trader\\nscheme.\\n\\n#### Check what a contractor says\\n\\nIt’s good idea to check what a contractor or their website tells you -\\nespecially if they’ve knocked on your door or telephoned you to offer their\\nservices. For instance, you can:\\n\\n  * ask to see a business card or letterhead, or get full contact details, then ring the business to check it exists and the contractor works for them\\n\\n  * ask to see proof of qualifications - for example an NVQ in construction for builders or a card from the Construction Skills Certification Scheme (trade associations can tell you about qualifications for particular types of work)\\n\\n  * check if the contractor is a member of the trade association they say they are - you should find a list of members on the trade association’s website\\n\\n##### If you have been provided with just a mobile number\\n\\nBe wary if a contractor just gives a mobile number. They may be hard to\\ncontact if problems come up. Make sure you do all the checks above in case\\nthey’re unreliable or dishonest.\\n\\n#### Interview contractors in person before you hire them\\n\\nBefore you meet them, it’s a good idea to write down:\\n\\n  * a clear and detailed description of exactly what you want done\\n\\n  * a list of questions to help you get all the information you need to compare and choose between contractors\\n\\nMake sure you can communicate with them easily - this will help you sort out\\nany problems that come up later.\\n\\nWhen you meet them, write down what they say they’ll do - if you do hire them\\nit’ll be helpful to have a record of the job details from this conversation,\\nas well as the written contract you’ll get before they start the work.\\n\\nIf you’re not comfortable with a particular contractor don’t hire them. You\\ncan always find someone else to do the work.\\n\\n##  Step 3: Get quotes before you decide who to use\\n\\nA quote is a promise from the contractor to do the work at a fixed price.\\nDon’t rely on a verbal quote - get it in writing.\\n\\nSome contractors charge for quotes - ask about this first.\\n\\nTry to get written quotes from at least 3 different contractors before you\\ndecide on one. Comparing quotes will help you decide if you’re getting a fair\\nprice.\\n\\nAfter you say yes to a quote, it’s a binding agreement between you and the\\ncontractor, whether it’s written down or not. But having it in writing means\\nyou can check what you agreed and prove it if there’s a dispute later.\\n\\n##### Quotes and estimates\\n\\nMake sure you get a quote, not an estimate. A quote is a fixed price, so\\nyou'll know what you’re getting and how much it will cost. An estimate is just\\na rough guess, so you could end up paying more.\\n\\nThe contractor can’t charge you more than the price on their quote unless:\\n\\n  * you ask for extra work that’s not included in the quote\\n\\n  * they let you know they have to do extra work and you agree to pay more for it\\n\\n  * they made a genuine mistake when writing down or calculating the price - they have the legal right to charge you what it should have been\\n\\n##### If you think your contractor is being dishonest\\n\\nBe wary if a contractor won’t put a quote in writing. It’s a sign they could\\nbe unreliable.\\n\\nAlso be cautious if their price is a lot lower than other quotes you get. It\\ncould mean they don’t have the right skills or experience, or they’re not\\nbeing honest. It could also mean they’re not quoting for exactly the same\\nwork.\\n\\n### What a quote should include\\n\\nBe very clear about the work you want done - this will help you get the most\\naccurate price and prevent misunderstandings later.\\n\\nA quote should include:\\n\\n  * a fixed total price - not a daily rate\\n\\n  * a breakdown of all the work to be done and the materials needed\\n\\n  * separate costs for each material and part of the work\\n\\n  * how long the price is valid for\\n\\n  * if the price includes VAT\\n\\n  * when the price can go up, eg only if you agree to extra work\\n\\nIf you get a daily rate instead of a fixed total price there’s a risk the\\ncontractor could string out the work to get more money. Avoid this by getting\\nthem to put in writing:\\n\\n  * how many days the work will take\\n\\n  * how many hours of work counts as a day\\n\\n  * when they need your go-ahead to work more days\\n\\n#### Check if your contractor has the correct insurance\\n\\nBefore saying yes to a quote, you should check the contractor has the correct\\ninsurance in place and try to get a written contract.\\n\\n#### See a sample quote\\n\\nYou can download a PDF of a sample quote.\\n\\n##  Step 4: Check there’s insurance in place\\n\\n### Contractors’ insurance - what to check\\n\\nAsk to see insurance policies and check they don’t run out before the work\\nwill be finished. If it’s insurance they must have, they have to let you see\\nthe policy.\\n\\n#### Insurance it's good to have\\n\\n**Public liability insurance** \\\\- it's worth asking contractors if they have\\ninsurance to cover you and them if someone’s hurt or property is damaged (eg\\nyour home or your neighbour’s). If they don't have any, you might want to\\nthink about getting your own cover.\\n\\n**Employers’ liability insurance** \\\\- contractors who work through a company\\nare breaking the law if they don’t have this. It doesn’t matter if it’s their\\nown company or not. It covers you and the company if they’re hurt on the job.\\n\\nImportant\\n\\n##### If your contractor doesn’t have insurance\\n\\nIf a contractor doesn’t have the right insurance, and things go wrong or\\nsomeone’s hurt, you could be forced to pay to fix things, or go to court and\\npay damages and legal fees.\\n\\n#### Other insurance to check for\\n\\nOther types of insurance may be available, but it’s worth remembering the\\ncontractor has to carry out the work with reasonable care and skill. If they\\ndon’t, you can ask them to redo the work or refund some of the cost.\\n\\n**Contractors’ all-risk cover** \\\\- this covers the cost of replacing work\\nthat’s destroyed before it’s completed, and before your insurance covers it.\\n\\n**Insurance-backed warranties or guarantees** \\\\- you can buy one of these as\\npart of the cost of the work, if the contractor offers it. Check exactly\\nwhat’s covered before you decide to buy one - it should cover the cost of\\nfinishing or fixing the work if the contractor does a bad job or goes out of\\nbusiness.\\n\\n### Your insurance - what to check\\n\\nIf you have home or contents insurance, contact your insurer to check you'll\\nbe covered during the work. You may have to pay more for your insurance during\\nand after the work.\\n\\nYour insurer will probably want to know what contractor you’re using and what\\ninsurance they have. They might suggest that you take out joint insurance with\\nthe contractor.\\n\\n#### How to protect yourself and your home against damage or loss\\n\\nIf you don’t have home and contents insurance, it’s worth looking into getting\\nsome before the work starts. You might feel more secure knowing you have\\ninsurance in place in case of any damage or if anything goes missing.\\n\\n##  Step 5: Get a written contract\\n\\nAs soon as you give a contractor the go-ahead, you’ve made a contract with\\nthem, even if it’s not written down.\\n\\nAlways try to get a contract in writing before you give the go-ahead. If the\\ncontractor doesn’t do what you agreed, a written contract can help you get\\nwhat you paid for, or at least get some of your money back.\\n\\nIf the contractor gives you a contract, check if it covers everything you\\nagreed. If they don’t you can write your own.\\n\\n#### If your contractor won’t provide you with anything in writing\\n\\nBe wary of contractors who won’t put anything in writing - it’s a sign they\\ncould be dishonest.\\n\\n### Help writing your own contract\\n\\nWritten contracts don’t need to be in legal language - they just need to\\noutline:\\n\\n  * exactly what you’re paying for (they can refer back to the quote for this)\\n\\n  * everything you’ve agreed on, eg timings, tidying up, materials and payments\\n\\nIt can help to look at example contracts, or create a contract using a\\ntemplate - eg for:\\n\\n  * home repairs or maintenance - you can download a free contract template\\n\\n  * building work - you can download an example contract or buy a contract template\\n\\n### Timings\\n\\nMake sure the contract covers:\\n\\n  * start and finish dates\\n\\n  * if you’ve agreed on a daily rate, the number of days the work will take and how many working hours are in a day\\n\\n  * delays - why they might happen, and what the contractor will do about them\\n\\n### Tidying up\\n\\nMake sure the contract covers:\\n\\n  * how and when the contractors will remove rubbish and clear up after themselves\\n\\n  * who pays for delivery and collection of any skips\\n\\n### Materials, equipment and subcontractors\\n\\nMake sure the contract covers:\\n\\n  * who pays to buy or hire materials and equipment for things the contractor buys, how they’ll give you receipts and paperwork\\n\\n  * if and when they’ll use subcontractors\\n\\n### Payments\\n\\nMake sure the contract covers how and when you’ll pay. Aim to:\\n\\n  * pay by card not cash\\n\\n  * pay in stages\\n\\n  * avoid deposits or upfront payments\\n\\n  * get some protection for your money\\n\\n#### If your contractor only accepts cash\\n\\nAvoid contractors who only accept cash or want you to pay everything upfront -\\nit’s a sign they could be dishonest or unreliable.\\n\\n#### Paying by card not cash\\n\\nIf you pay by credit or debit card, you may be able to get your money back\\nthrough your bank if something goes wrong, eg the contractor doesn’t turn up\\nbut refuses to pay back your deposit.\\n\\nIf this happens, you can contact your bank and say you want to use the\\n‘chargeback’ scheme.\\n\\nIf you pay more than £100 by credit card, it may be easier to tell your bank\\nyou want to ‘make a section 75 claim’.

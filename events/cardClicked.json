They will look at your income, outgoings, debts and assets. - To apply for a DRO, you need to pay a ¬£90 fee. The application is sent to an official receiver at the Insolvency Service who will make a decision.- If approved, the DRO lasts usually for 1 year. During this time, your debts are frozen.

If you get a refund over ¬£1000 for mis-sold PPI while under a DRO, your DRO could be cancelled.- Citizens Advice is authorized to help clients apply for DROs on their behalf.In summary, a DRO is an agreement made through an adviser to freeze and eventually cancel debts if you cannot afford to pay"

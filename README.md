# Caddy Chatbot

Caddy is an LLM powered co-pilot for customer service functions everywhere. This contains the logic for the chatbot and responses, and also relies on storage of the data using [caddy-scraper](https://github.com/i-dot-ai/caddy-scraper).

## How to Run

### Environment Management
We recommend using [Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) for managing dependencies.

To create your virtual environment, run

```bash
$ 	poetry install
$ 	poetry shell
```

Then set up your local dev environment with `make setup-local-environment`.

### Local dynamoDB

To run the project against a [local dynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.html), set the `DYNAMODB_URL` env var to the address of a locally running `dynamodb-local`. For example:

```bash
$    brew install dynamodb-local
$    dynamodb-local -port 32331 -dbPath $(pwd)/db
```

The correct value for `DYNAMODB_URL` if started with those arguments will be `http://localhost:32331`.

Note that the test suite requires dynamodb to be running, which is (for now!) a manual process, as above.

### Running tests

```bash
$     poetry run pytest
```

### Semantic router

By default the semantic-router library will embed all the `utterances` it uses to perform semantic routing, each time the app starts up.

To avoid doing this work every time you restart, you can cache the embeddings in postgres.

Set `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING` in `.env` (see example in `example.env`) to use this feature.

**Important** if you use this feature and change the routes, you'll need to reset the postgres database yourself.

Coming soon: docker-compose to do this all for you.

### AWS CLI

You will require AWS CLI, either [installed directly](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) or through [pip](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli).

To confirm install, run

```bash
$ aws --version
```

To configure, run

```bash
$ aws configure
```


### Use vscode on github (codespace)

To develop in codespaces, ensure you define your environment variables through Github settings.

[![Open in Remote - Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Remote%20-%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://codespaces.new/i-dot-ai/caddy-chatbot?quickstart=1)

If you are using windows or do not want to install vscode on your machine, you can click on the badge above to spin up a codespace environment.

## Developing Caddy API

To work on developing the core Caddy API, run the below command which will start up the FastAPI with the reload flag enabled for convenience

```bash
$ make run-dev
```

## Developing with Local DynamoDB

To explore the connection to DynamoDB, I have attached the docker-compose file to spin up a local DynamoDB.  This will have to be span up before using the relevant notebook.

```bash
$ docker compose up
```

If you get an error with docker, note you may need to change credsStore your .docker/config.json file with:

```json
"credStore": "desktop",
```

## Deployment

We'll use AWS CLI and Docker to create and deploy all the relevant resources.

Build and push the container image to your elastic container registry
```bash
$ aws ecr get-login-password | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin "INSERT_ELASTIC_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_ENDPOINT"
```

```bash
$ docker build -f ./caddy_chatbot/Dockerfile -t "INSERT_CONTAINER_REPO_ID":"IMAGE_TAG" .
```

```bash
$ docker tag "INSERT_CONTAINER_REPO_ID":"IMAGE_TAG" "INSERT_ELASTIC_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_ENDPOINT"/"INSERT_CONTAINER_REPO_ID":"IMAGE_TAG"
```

```bash
$ docker push "INSERT_ELASTIC_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_ENDPOINT"/"INSERT_CONTAINER_REPO_ID":"IMAGE_TAG"
```

Once the build is complete, you can deploy the stack with

```bash
$ aws cloudformation deploy --template-file infra/template.yaml --stack-name "INSERT_CUSTOM_STACK_NAME" --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM --parameter-overrides StageName="INSERT_STAGE_NAME"  MessageTableName="INSERT_CADDY_MESSAGE_TABLE_NAME" ResponsesTableName="INSERT_CADDY_RESPONSES_TABLE_NAME" UserTableName="INSERT_CADDY_USERS_TABLE_NAME" OfficesTableName="INSERT_CADDY_OFFICES_TABLE_NAME" EvaluationTableName="INSERT_CADDY_EVALUATION_TABLE_NAME" OpensearchUrl="INSERT_OPENSEARCH_URL*" CaddyServiceAccountSecretArn="INSERT_CADDY_GOOGLE_CHAT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_SECRET_ARN" CaddySupervisorServiceAccountSecretArn="INSERT_CADDY_SUPERVISOR_GOOGLE_CHAT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_SECRET_ARN" CaddyImage="INSERT_ELASTIC_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_ENDPOINT"/"INSERT_CONTAINER_REPO_ID":"IMAGE_TAG" CaddySupervisorGoogleCloudProject="INSERT_CADDY_SUPERVISOR_GOOGLE_CHAT_PROJECT_ID" CaddyGoogleCloudProject="INSERT_CADDY_GOOGLE_CHAT_PROJECT_ID" LLM="INSERT_BEDROCK_LLM_MODEL" DomainName="INSERT_DOMAIN_NAME_FOR_SSL_CERT" #pragma: allowlist secret
```
* *OpensearchUrl*: Opensearch is not built into the template yet this must be configured seperately
* *CaddyServiceAccountSecretArn*: Creation of Caddy Google Chat service account in Secret Manager is not built into the template yet and must be created manually
* *CaddySupervisorServiceAccountSecretArn*: Creation of Caddy Supervisor Google Chat service account in Secret Manager is not built into the template yet and must be created manually

For ease of deletion, you can remove all the created resources with

```bash
$ aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name "INSERT_CUSTOM_STACK_NAME"
```

## Local Teams Deployment

In azure (https://portal.azure.com/#home), creat an azure bot, and add app_id, app_password to the .env from configuration space.

Then you need to build the container and provide a tunnel.

```bash
$ docker compose up
```

Go to ngrok dashboard (https://dashboard.ngrok.com/) and create a domain then expose the domain endpoint for local forwarding on the desired port i.e. 80

```bash
$ ngrok http --domain=insert-static-url 80
```

If you recieve a ngrok 381 errror, this is because ngrok has created an automatic edge. Delete the edge in ngrok dashboard and retry command

In azure bot  got to setting > configuration and add static-url with /microsoft-teams/chat into the messaging endpoint
Then in channels use the open in teams button to test locally

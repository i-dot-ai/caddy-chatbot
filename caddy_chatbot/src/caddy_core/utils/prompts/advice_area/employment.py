For example, if the question is "I am about to return to work after maternity leave, but I
canâ€™t continue working evenings and weekends because of childcare issues. My employer has
rejected my flexible working request on the basis that all staff have to work evenings and
weekends. Is this fair and what are my rights in this situation?" you could respond with:
-----
You are entitled to make a flexible working request to your employer to vary your terms and
conditions of employment to suit your needs. Your employer must follow a fair process and
can only refuse your request on certain grounds. You have the right to appeal against this decision.

If your employer turned down your flexible working request on the basis that the same workplace
rules apply to everyone regardless of their circumstances,  you might be able to show this is
discriminatory because the rule about working evenings and weekends has a bigger impact on you
because you have childcare or caring responsibilities.

NOTE: Advisors will ask you to provide advice on a citizen's question which can often be
cross-cutting - this means that the question will have multiple themes. It's important to
understand that a client seeking advice related to employment are also likely to be advised on
benefits and tax credits, universal credit, debt, charitable support (such as grants) and food banks
as well as financial services and capability. You must think step-by-step about the question
identifying any evidence of these present in the query and formulate your response to the advisor
accordingly

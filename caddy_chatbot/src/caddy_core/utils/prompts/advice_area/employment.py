For example, if the question is "I am about to return to work after maternity leave, but I
can’t continue working evenings and weekends because of childcare issues. My employer has
rejected my flexible working request on the basis that all staff have to work evenings and
weekends. Is this fair and what are my rights in this situation?" you could respond with:
-----
You are entitled to make a flexible working request to your employer to vary your terms and
conditions of employment to suit your needs. Your employer must follow a fair process and
can only refuse your request on certain grounds. You have the right to appeal against this decision.

If your employer turned down your flexible working request on the basis that the same workplace
rules apply to everyone regardless of their circumstances,  you might be able to show this is
discriminatory because the rule about working evenings and weekends has a bigger impact on you
because you have childcare or caring responsibilities.

Another example is: "I’ve been dismissed for redundancy after 22 years of employment. How much redundancy pay am I entitled to receive from my employer? Am I entitled to any other payments? I am 64 years old on the date of dismissal and my average weekly earning were £650" you could respond with:
-----
You are entitled to £19,290 statutory redundancy pay as a minimum amount, your contract of employment may say that you are entitled to more. 

You can check this using the Gov.uk Redundancy Pay calculator and by asking your employer if you are entitled to contractual redundancy pay.

You are also entitled to be paid wages up to the date of dismissal and any accrued but untaken holiday pay. You are entitled to receive 12 weeks notice, which the employer can either make you work or make a payment in lieu of notice - there may be other contractual payments due on dismissal, depending on the terms and conditions of employment.

Another example is: "My client’s employer has refused to allow her to take paid time off on holiday and isn’t paying her correctly for all of the hours that she works. I want to know more about her employment rights and options in this situation. Does the fact that she is employed on a Health and Social Care Visa make any difference to your advice?" you could respond with:
-----
You are entitled to be paid correctly for all hours worked in accordance with your contract of employment. Failure to do so can be treated as a breach of contract or an unauthorised deductions from wages. It can also be a breach of the National Minimum Wage rules if your pay is below the minimum rate the law says you should be paid for your age group.

You are also entitled to be paid at your normal rate of pay when you take holiday. The amount of paid holiday you are entitled to is a minimum of 28 days each year. In your first year of employment, your employer only has to pay you for as many days you have built up when you take your holiday.

If your employer hasn’t paid you correctly for wages or holiday pay, you should speak to them about it. If this doesn’t work, you should make a formal complaint, known as a grievance. If you are still not satisfied, you can make a claim to an employment tribunal, but you must take action within 3 months of the last date that you were not paid correctly.

If your complaint is about the National Minimum Wage, you can make a complaint to the Government’s National Minimum Wage Enforcement team.

Because you are on a Health and Social Care Visa, your right to work and live in the UK is linked to your sponsor employer. Sometimes complaints about employment rights can lead to problems with your employer, possibly causing the withdrawal of your Visa.

You should speak to a Citizens Advice adviser about your situation before you decide to take action about your problems with wages.
-----
NOTE: Advisors will ask you to provide advice on a citizen's question which can often be
cross-cutting - this means that the question will have multiple themes. These themes could be
discrimation, dismissal, dispute resolution, employment tribunals and appeals. It's important to
understand that a client seeking advice related to employment are also likely to be advised on
benefits and tax credits, universal credit, debt, charitable support (such as grants) and food banks
as well as financial services and capability. You must think step-by-step about the question
identifying any evidence of these present in the query and formulate your response to the advisor
accordingly

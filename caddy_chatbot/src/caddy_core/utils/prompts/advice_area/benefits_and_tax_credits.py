For example, if the question is "I get PIP as Im disabled,
but I also care for my elderly mum (aged 76). Can I claim Carers Allowance?"
you could respond with:
-----
If your mum receives a disability benefit (middle/higher rate care component of DLA,
daily living component of PIP, or AA), are not in gainful employment and you provide
35 hours a week care you might be able to claim CA.

If your mum gets a severe disability addition/premium in Pension Credit or Housing Benefit
this will stop if you are paid Carers Allowance.

If you get the daily living component of PIP, the DWP might look again at your PIP award
if the activities you are able to carry out as a carer for your mum suggest that you don’t
need help with your own daily living activities. Being a carer and qualifying for PIP aren’t
necessarily incompatible.  It will depend on the reasons you get PIP and the tasks you carry
out for your mum. For example, if you have a mental health condition and need prompting to carry
out daily living tasks, but are physically able to carry them out there wouldn’t be a contradiction
in receiving PIP and being a carer.

NOTE: Advisors will ask you to provide advice on a citizen's question which can often be
cross-cutting - this means that the question will have multiple themes. It's important to
understand that a client seeking advice related to benefits and tax credits is likely to also
be advised on universal credit, charitable support (such as grants) and food banks, debt and
utilities, communications and energy issues. You must think step-by-step
about the question identifying any evidence of these present in the query and formulate your response
to the advisor accordingly

For example, if the question is "Ive moved into a leasehold flat and have to pay
service charges of Â£40 per week.  I get UC, can I get help to pay the charges?"
you could respond with:
-----
Yes, a housing costs element in UC can be paid for service charges that you
have to pay to occupy your home. They must be related to the provision of adequate
accommodation. Examples of service charges that may be included are:

Charges for using shared facilities, such as rubbish collection or communal lifts
Charges for using essential items in your home, such as domestic appliances
Charges window cleaning of upper floors

NOTE: Advisors will ask you to provide advice on a citizen's question which can often be
cross-cutting - this means that the question will have multiple themes. It's important to
understand that a client seeking advice related to benefits universal credit is likely to also
be advised on benefits and tax credits, charitable support (such as grants) and food banks, debt
and utilities, communications and energy issues. You must think step-by-step
about the question identifying any evidence of these present in the query and formulate your response
to the advisor accordingly

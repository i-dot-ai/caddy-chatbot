For example, if the question is "My energy bill is much higher than I thought it should be.
Is my meter faulty?" you could respond with:
-----
You shouldn't assume that there is a fault with the meter, because your bill is higher than expected.
Meter faults happen, but they are very rare. It’s a good idea to check first if there are other reasons
that may explain the increase.

The first thing you’ll need to check is if your bill is accurate. You should check whether your bill is
the bill estimated. It will have an E next to the reading in your bill if it is. If your bill closes on
an estimate, it may be that it has been overestimated. Even if you’ve got a smart meter, it’s a good idea
to check - your smart meter might not have been sending meter readings to the supplier.

You should also check whether you are billed for the right meter. If you’ve switched suppliers, compare
the meter reference number from their old supplier’s bill to their new supplier’s bill. Otherwise you’ll
need to find the meter reference number on your network operator’s website and compare it.

It’s also a good idea to compare the meter reading on the meter to the one you’ve got on the bill. If it’s
similar, then you are probably billed for the correct usage. Check this on the meter and not your In Home
Display. You can compare this with other bills and see whether your usage has gone up considerably. There
might be reasons for this, like someone has started working from home, cold weather or a new appliance.

If it isn’t usage and the bill is accurate you’ll need to look at whether there are any reasons for the
ost going up. It might be that a fixed tariff has come to an end and your unit rates or daily charges
(standing charges) have increased.

If you can’t find any other reason for the increase in cost, then your meter might be faulty. This is
very rare, but it can happen. To check whether it may be faulty you can start by switching off all
electrical appliances in the home at the consumer unit and switch off power to the boiler. You should
check if the numbers on the meter's display are still moving - if they are, the meter might be faulty.
If your gas meter is still moving  there could be a gas leak you should call the National Gas Emergencies
number on 0800 111 999 from outside of the property.
If you think your meter is faulty, complain to your supplier. They should investigate it within 5 working
days and tell you what action they’ll take. If they take the meter out to be tested they might charge you.
If your meter is found to be faulty they’ll refund you. You should ask your supplier about any costs
that may be involved in getting the meter tested.

Follow up questions
Do they have a two rate meter? If so, do they know how to read the meter
Are they able to afford to make the payments? If not, they may need a repayment plan or debt advice
Is your supplier asking for any payments that are from more than 12 months ago?

Another example is: "I’m thinking about getting some energy efficiency measures installed privately. What do I need to think about before going ahead with any work?" you could respond with:

Energy efficiency answer
One of the first things to think about is your budget. You also need to consider which measures are suitable for your home and if you’re thinking about more than one measure, what’s best to do first. 

Your home’s Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) should tell you where your home’s energy efficiency needs improving and the approximate cost. You can work out the ‘payback period’ by dividing the cost of the work by the yearly saving in your energy bills. If you own your home, you can get recommendations for improvements you can make to your home on GOV.UK.
Check if your mortgage provider offers any mortgage products linked to making energy efficiency improvements to your home. 
If you live in an older home, there are some extra things you might need to think about before making changes to your home. Find out more about energy efficiency and older houses on the Historic England website.
If you’re a leaseholder, you might need to get permission from the owner of the freehold before you make any improvements. You can find out about making changes to your leasehold property on the Leasehold Advisory Service website.
Contact your local council to check if there are support schemes or energy advice agencies in your area that can help. Find your local council's contact details on GOV.UK.

Consumer answer
It’s important to use a reputable installer so you can trust them and to help protect you if anything goes wrong. The Microgeneration Certification (MCS) scheme is a quality mark for low carbon heating (for example, heat pumps) and renewable energy generation (for example, solar panels). Using an MCS certified installer ensures that equipment meets good standards of performance and that installers are technically safe and competent. You can find an MCS certified installer by using their ‘find an installer’ search.

TrustMark is the government approved quality scheme. You can find a TrustMark installer by using their ‘find a business’ search. 

Both MCS and TrustMark have dispute resolution processes which can help if anything does go wrong. 

If you’re paying for the work yourself, think about how you pay for it. It’s worth using a credit card so you can benefit from what’s called s75 protection if something does go wrong. This means your card provider is jointly responsible - with the installer - for resolving the problem. You can read more about this on Citizens Advice website Getting your money back if you paid by card or Paypal.

NOTE: Advisors will ask you to provide advice on a citizen's question which can often be
cross-cutting - this means that the question will have multiple themes. It's important to
understand that a client seeking advice related to utilities and communications, benefits and tax
credits, debt, charitable support (such as grants) and food banks as well as consumer goods
and services. You must think step-by-step about the question identifying any evidence of these present
in the query and formulate your response to the advisor accordingly

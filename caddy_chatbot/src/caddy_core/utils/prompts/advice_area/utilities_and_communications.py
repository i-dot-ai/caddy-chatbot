For example, if the question is "My energy bill is much higher than I thought it should be.
Is my meter faulty?" you could respond with:
-----
You shouldn't assume that there is a fault with the meter, because your bill is higher than expected.
Meter faults happen, but they are very rare. It’s a good idea to check first if there are other reasons
that may explain the increase.

The first thing you’ll need to check is if your bill is accurate. You should check whether your bill is
the bill estimated. It will have an E next to the reading in your bill if it is. If your bill closes on
an estimate, it may be that it has been overestimated. Even if you’ve got a smart meter, it’s a good idea
to check - your smart meter might not have been sending meter readings to the supplier.

You should also check whether you are billed for the right meter. If you’ve switched suppliers, compare
the meter reference number from their old supplier’s bill to their new supplier’s bill. Otherwise you’ll
need to find the meter reference number on your network operator’s website and compare it.

It’s also a good idea to compare the meter reading on the meter to the one you’ve got on the bill. If it’s
similar, then you are probably billed for the correct usage. Check this on the meter and not your In Home
Display. You can compare this with other bills and see whether your usage has gone up considerably. There
might be reasons for this, like someone has started working from home, cold weather or a new appliance.

If it isn’t usage and the bill is accurate you’ll need to look at whether there are any reasons for the
ost going up. It might be that a fixed tariff has come to an end and your unit rates or daily charges
(standing charges) have increased.

If you can’t find any other reason for the increase in cost, then your meter might be faulty. This is
very rare, but it can happen. To check whether it may be faulty you can start by switching off all
electrical appliances in the home at the consumer unit and switch off power to the boiler. You should
check if the numbers on the meter's display are still moving - if they are, the meter might be faulty.
If your gas meter is still moving  there could be a gas leak you should call the National Gas Emergencies
number on 0800 111 999 from outside of the property.
If you think your meter is faulty, complain to your supplier. They should investigate it within 5 working
days and tell you what action they’ll take. If they take the meter out to be tested they might charge you.
If your meter is found to be faulty they’ll refund you. You should ask your supplier about any costs
that may be involved in getting the meter tested.

Follow up questions
Do they have a two rate meter? If so, do they know how to read the meter
Are they able to afford to make the payments? If not, they may need a repayment plan or debt advice
Is your supplier asking for any payments that are from more than 12 months ago?

understand that a client seeking advice related to utilities and communications, benefits and tax

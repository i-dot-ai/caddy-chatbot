NOTE: Advisors will ask you to provide advice on a citizen's question which can often be
cross-cutting - this means that the question will have multiple themes. It's important to
understand that a client seeking advice related to financial services and capability is also
likely to be advised on benefits and tax credits, debt, utilities, communications and energy
supplier issues. You must think step-by-step about the question identifying any evidence
of these present in the query and formulate your response to the advisor accordingly

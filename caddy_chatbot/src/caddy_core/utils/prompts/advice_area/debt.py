For example, if the question is "Im 55 and I have a small pension pot. I owe £35,000 in various
debts and want to get a DRO. I need my pension for later life. Can I get a DRO or do I need to go
bankrupt? I have about £10,000 equity in my house but half of that is my husbands who no longer
lives with me." you could respond with:
-----
You can't get a DRO as you have an interest in a property. You also owe more than £30,000
which is the limit for a DRO, although not all debts count towards that. You could consider bankruptcy
but should get debt advice. There are no eligibility criteria as such for bankruptcy, although it will
cost you £680. You might be able to get help with this fee form a charity or trust fund and you can pay
this in instalments. You should be aware that: Any unapproved pension will be classed as an asset and taken
to pay your debts by the person that controls your bankruptcy, known as the Trustee, although you can ask
your Trustee to make an agreement not to take your pension but it will be up to the Trustee. You have to
ask them within 9 weeks of going bankrupt. You can apply to court to have the pension made exempt within
13 weeks of your bankruptcy, and it will be up to the court what order to make. You should try to get
legal advice on what arguments to raise, for instance, if you need to fund any care needs, whether the
pension is approved by a foreign tax authority if the pension is from overseas etc
You will not be forced to take any personal pension that is approved as these are protected by law from
bankruptcy. However, as you are over 55, you will probably be able to take your pension if you want to.
Therefore, the person that agrees you can go bankrupt, known as the Adjudicator, might decide you are still
able to pay your debts if the value of your pension after taxes and costs, is more than your debts.
You will not be forced to take your pension, but you might not get your bankruptcy order and you would not
get your £680 refunded If you did go bankrupt and drew on your pension, any lump sum might then be claimed
by the Trustee and any income you are paid will be used to assess whether you can make payments into an
income payment arrangement or order, to repay bankruptcy debts. If you do get a bankruptcy order, the
Trustee has 3 years to decide what to do with the equity in your home. They usually won't sell it for at
least 1 year after you go bankrupt. You can try to delay this sale but might need to go to court to do so,
and the court will only usually delay the sale further if you have exceptional circumstances. You and your
husband probably have a 50/50 share of the equity, known as 'beneficial interest.' Therefore, your share
of the equity is probably £5000. The Trustee is likely to value your home after 2 years and 3 months to
see if there is more equity If you have more than £5000 equity as your share at that point, the Trustee
may apply for a charging order or an order to sell your home. This might happen much sooner if your home
goes up in value quickly. If you have less than £5000 the Trustee is unlikely to apply for a charging
order or order for sale as there will not be anything left to pay creditors after costs, but this is
just a guide of course. A third party could make an offer to buy your share of the property, to the
Trustee. You should always take legal advice about this, and be certain that the third party will let you
stay in the property You or your husband may claim to have more than 50 percent share in the equity, for instance
if you paid the entire deposit for the house and used only your funds. This is a complicated area of law
and you should get legal advice if you want to claim more or less than 50 percent share. You should decide this
before going bankrupt but any agreement must be for the right consideration
If you later go bankrupt and the Trustee believes you have given away all or part of your equity, in order
not to pay creditors, you might have a longer bankruptcy period. This is known as a bankruptcy restriction
order, and can last between 2-15 years. The Trustee might also try to seek payment from the other person to
recover the lost value, or ask a court to reverse the transaction
The Trustee can review any sale or transfer of assets if they occurred in the 5 years before your bankruptcy
if the person you gave away or sold to, was an 'associate' like a business partner or family member. There
is no time limit where the Trustee thinks you did this on purpose to avoid paying creditors
The Trustee in bankruptcy may argue you have more than 50 perfect in order to claim more funds for creditors,
but ultimately only a court can decide the shares
The Trustee may still allow you to sell your home if this will raise more funds, but you should get their
consent. However, if you own the home jointly with someone else, you do not need the Trustee's consent to
sell You should also be aware that bankruptcy will not stop certain creditors chasing you for payment. These are
court fines, family or child maintenance arrangements, social fund loans, student loans, debt incurred
through fraud, and damages for negligence and injury
----
Another example is: "Can I get a breathing space to stop my creditors chasing me, and how long will it last?" you could respond with:
-----
You have to meet certain eligibility criteria such as not being subject to another insolvency procedure, you must live in E&W and owe a ‘qualifying debt.’ You must not be subject to a mental health crisis moratorium, standard breathing space moratorium, and not have had a standard breathing space moratorium that ended in the last 12 months.  
You must be unable or unlikely to pay some or all of your debts as they fall due, and the moratorium must be ‘appropriate.’ You must see a debt adviser to get a moratorium and they will decide whether it is appropriate, considering things like whether you can pay your debts, whether you will be able to enter a debt solution during or soon after your moratorium, and whether you need the moratorium time for the adviser to consider your options and put in place a recommendation for you. 
A breathing space moratorium typically will last 60 days. 
If you have a serious mental health condition and are in crisis treatment, you might be eligible for a mental health crisis moratorium. These last as long as your crisis treatment, plus 30 days. Most of the criteria above will apply, but you can have as many of these moratoria within 12 months as needed, so long as you are in crisis treatment. You will still need a debt adviser to enter you into the scheme, and an approved mental health professional will have to provide evidence that you are in crisis treatment. 
When the debt adviser is considering whether a mental health crisis moratorium is suitable, they might ask for more medical evidence from a mental health professional. They have to get a credit report on your behalf as well. 
The adviser might not have to consider whether you can move into a debt solution quickly, like in a standard breathing space, but they will need to work with you as much as you are able, to help with your debts. Your nominated point of contact (usually a health professional like a MH nurse) will have to provide evidence that you are still in crisis treatment, every 30 days. Otherwise your moratorium will end 30 days after the point they should have provided it. 
Some creditors can still chase you for money even in a standard or mental health crisis moratorium, such as for child maintenance, a court fine, a universal credit advance, social fund loan, student loan or any debt incurred through fraud. Any council tax arrears where the council has not sent a reminder can be chased, as well as any payments you have to make for damages for personal injury. If you have deductions to pay bills from your universal credit, these will continue, and if you agreed to have a pre-payment meter installed before your moratorium, that meter can be installed. 
You will also be expected to pay your ongoing bills during a standard moratorium.

Another example is: "I’m about to get evicted by the bank but I don’t have anywhere to go. I’m worried as my employment contract says I might lose my job if I get a court judgment against me. Can you help me?" you could respond with:
-----
Most lenders will apply for a money judgment as well as possession, so you might need employment advice about your work contract. 

It’s important to know where you are in the eviction process. Before you are evicted your lender has to take you to court for a possession hearing. If the Judge gives the lender a possession order, you will be given a date to leave your home. On that date, if you do not move out, the lender will have to apply for a warrant of possession. That warrant allows bailiffs to return on a given date to evict you. If you do not leave they do have powers to use reasonable force to make you leave. If you have not yet been to court at all, you will have more opportunity to negotiate with the lender. If you feel able to, you should always contact your mortgage lender whatever the stage. 

If they have not yet taken you to court, they have a lot of rules to follow, and these continue up to actual possession. They might be able to help by agreeing a repayment plan, reducing your monthly payments temporarily if your income might increase in future, or by allowing you to miss payments for a few months (known as mortgage deferral). You would still have to make up these payments later. They might add your arrears on to the end of your mortgage, known as ‘capitalising’ arrears if you can afford to pay the slightly increased monthly amounts this would require. Always consider getting debt advice to help (link) 

As with any debt case, you should maximise your income as best you can (link to our pages) and also reduce non-essential expenditure where possible (link to our page). If you receive Universal Credit or another means tested benefit, you can apply to have some of the interest on your mortgage paid by an interest free loan, called support for mortgage interest. You have to apply for this support and will usually have to wait 13 weeks before it is paid, or 9 months on legacy benefits, like JSA, ESA or income support. If you get pension credit, payments start straight away.  

Assuming you agree you owe the mortgage and it was not incurred due to fraud or undue pressure, you should complete the defence form you are sent (called the N11M) if you are being taken to court for a possession hearing. You should also seek advice from a debt adviser or legal aid provider, if you qualify for legal aid, as your home is at risk. On the day of the hearing, you should also try to meet with the duty scheme solicitor at court. When completing the N11M you should check carefully whether the lender has included the right amount of arrears as they sometimes get this wrong if they add in other charges. You should return the N11M to the court, and send a copy to the lender’s solicitors, within 14 days of any hearing. If you miss this deadline, still send it in late. Even if you do not send it at all the court will let you take part in the hearing but they might make you pay more costs if they have to rearrange a hearing.

You should complete the budget sheet on the N11M and prioritise paying your mortgage arrears. If you’re not sure how to prioritise your debts, you can read about this on our advice pages (link) and get advice from a debt adviser (link). If you are able to make an offer to pay the arrears, you should do so before the court hearing. The lender might agree to stop the court hearing, or at least agree to ask for suspended possession, based on you paying what you have offered alongside regular payments. This means you will not lose your home so long as the payments are made. In any case, you should start to pay what you can afford. Usually the court will give you up to the end of your agreement term to pay arrears back, but you should try to pay more quickly if possible. 

There are also lots of rules a lender has to follow before going to court. If they have not given you the chance to negotiate payments at all, or have refused offers that you think are reasonable, or if you have a complaint with them that has not been dealt with, you should raise this in section 27 of the N11M. The court might agree to rearrange (known as adjourning) the hearing for the lender to engage with you. Likewise, if you have made an application for support for mortgage interest and can prove this, alongside showing you can make the payments to cover anything SMI does not cover, you should raise this. The lender may have been wrong to have started the claim and the court might adjourn it. 

If you do not think you can pay your arrears back within the term of your agreement, or you cannot afford to pay the monthly contractual payments, it is more likely the court will agree to repossession. You might be able to apply for something called a time order in these circumstances, to ask the court to extend the period you pay back for, or to lower the interest rate to make payments affordable. You should get advice on this first though. With a time order the court can also consider more circumstances than just whether you can afford a particular amount, for example, whether an illness has caused the arrears or if a lender has behaved unfairly towards you by adding lots of charges or refusing offers that would have controlled the arrears earlier. They will decide what is ‘just’ in all of the circumstances although that might still mean giving possession to the lender. 

If you have already been to court and you are referring to the date that you are to be evicted, the situation is more urgent. If this is the date the court gave at the possession hearing, you do not have to leave on that day. If you do not leave, the lender will apply to court for a warrant to use bailiffs to forcibly evict you at a later date. You should get legal advice if possible, certainly if you qualify for legal aid (link). As you have nowhere to go, you could consider:

●	Applying on form N244 to suspend the possession date, or thee actual eviction, but you will have to show that you can make payments towards the arrears and maintain the contractual monthly payments (£14 unless you get fee remission - link)
●	Apply on form N244 (£14 unless fee remission - link) and seek a time order if you are unable to make an offer that will cover the arrears and monthly payment, or need interest to be reduced, or the term of the agreement extending to make things affordable 
●	If the home is simply unaffordable, negotiate with the lender for more time maybe to sell, or see if they will help you sell it in a controlled way 
●	You should only hand the keys back to the lender as a last resort as you will still be liable for the mortgage, insurances and bills

On the day of any eviction, the bailiffs that the court will use, are allowed to use reasonable force and are likely to change the locks on your door. They should give you time to remove your goods and you should act quickly as soon as you get any notice of an eviction date. 

If your home is repossessed and sold at auction you are likely to get much less for it. It might not even cover the mortgage debt(s) and your lender will be able to chase you for the remainder of the debt. 

Finally, you might be able to get something called a ‘breathing space.’ This is free but you need to apply with the help of a debt adviser who will assess whether you are eligible and whether it is appropriate. You can find out more about Breathing Space here (link). Importantly:

●	breathing space will stop and enforcement of your mortgage for 60 days
●	if you have a hearing listed, that can still go ahead and a court might still grant possession, but it cannot be enforced for 60 days
●	if you are due to be evicted by bailiffs, this will also be paused for 60 days 

If you are receiving mental health crisis treatment you might be able to get a breathing space that lasts as long as your treatment, plus 30 days. Again a debt adviser will discuss this with you. 

The breathing space protections apply the day after application is submitted. Therefore, you will not be protected from eviction if you apply on the same day as your eviction unless the lender agrees to call off the bailiff.

NOTE: Advisors will ask you to provide advice on a citizen's question which can often be
cross-cutting - this means that the question will have multiple themes. It's important to
understand that a client seeking advice related to debt is also likely to be advised on benefits and tax
credits, utilities, communications and energy supplier issues, charitable support (such as grants) and
food banks. You must think step-by-step about the question identifying any evidence of these present
in the query and formulate your response to the advisor accordingly

For example, if the question is "Im 55 and I have a small pension pot. I owe £35,000 in various
debts and want to get a DRO. I need my pension for later life. Can I get a DRO or do I need to go
bankrupt? I have about £10,000 equity in my house but half of that is my husbands who no longer
lives with me." you could respond with:
-----
You can't get a DRO as you have an interest in a property. You also owe more than £30,000
which is the limit for a DRO, although not all debts count towards that. You could consider bankruptcy
but should get debt advice. There are no eligibility criteria as such for bankruptcy, although it will
cost you £680. You might be able to get help with this fee form a charity or trust fund and you can pay
this in instalments. You should be aware that: Any unapproved pension will be classed as an asset and taken
to pay your debts by the person that controls your bankruptcy, known as the Trustee, although you can ask
your Trustee to make an agreement not to take your pension but it will be up to the Trustee. You have to
ask them within 9 weeks of going bankrupt. You can apply to court to have the pension made exempt within
13 weeks of your bankruptcy, and it will be up to the court what order to make. You should try to get
legal advice on what arguments to raise, for instance, if you need to fund any care needs, whether the
pension is approved by a foreign tax authority if the pension is from overseas etc
You will not be forced to take any personal pension that is approved as these are protected by law from
bankruptcy. However, as you are over 55, you will probably be able to take your pension if you want to.
Therefore, the person that agrees you can go bankrupt, known as the Adjudicator, might decide you are still
able to pay your debts if the value of your pension after taxes and costs, is more than your debts.
You will not be forced to take your pension, but you might not get your bankruptcy order and you would not
get your £680 refunded If you did go bankrupt and drew on your pension, any lump sum might then be claimed
by the Trustee and any income you are paid will be used to assess whether you can make payments into an
income payment arrangement or order, to repay bankruptcy debts. If you do get a bankruptcy order, the
Trustee has 3 years to decide what to do with the equity in your home. They usually won't sell it for at
least 1 year after you go bankrupt. You can try to delay this sale but might need to go to court to do so,
and the court will only usually delay the sale further if you have exceptional circumstances. You and your
husband probably have a 50/50 share of the equity, known as 'beneficial interest.' Therefore, your share
of the equity is probably £5000. The Trustee is likely to value your home after 2 years and 3 months to
see if there is more equity If you have more than £5000 equity as your share at that point, the Trustee
may apply for a charging order or an order to sell your home. This might happen much sooner if your home
goes up in value quickly. If you have less than £5000 the Trustee is unlikely to apply for a charging
order or order for sale as there will not be anything left to pay creditors after costs, but this is
just a guide of course. A third party could make an offer to buy your share of the property, to the
Trustee. You should always take legal advice about this, and be certain that the third party will let you
stay in the property You or your husband may claim to have more than 50 percent share in the equity, for instance
if you paid the entire deposit for the house and used only your funds. This is a complicated area of law
and you should get legal advice if you want to claim more or less than 50 percent share. You should decide this
before going bankrupt but any agreement must be for the right consideration
If you later go bankrupt and the Trustee believes you have given away all or part of your equity, in order
not to pay creditors, you might have a longer bankruptcy period. This is known as a bankruptcy restriction
order, and can last between 2-15 years. The Trustee might also try to seek payment from the other person to
recover the lost value, or ask a court to reverse the transaction
The Trustee can review any sale or transfer of assets if they occurred in the 5 years before your bankruptcy
if the person you gave away or sold to, was an 'associate' like a business partner or family member. There
is no time limit where the Trustee thinks you did this on purpose to avoid paying creditors
The Trustee in bankruptcy may argue you have more than 50 perfect in order to claim more funds for creditors,
but ultimately only a court can decide the shares
The Trustee may still allow you to sell your home if this will raise more funds, but you should get their
consent. However, if you own the home jointly with someone else, you do not need the Trustee's consent to
sell You should also be aware that bankruptcy will not stop certain creditors chasing you for payment. These are
court fines, family or child maintenance arrangements, social fund loans, student loans, debt incurred
through fraud, and damages for negligence and injury
----
Another example is: "Can I get a breathing space to stop my creditors chasing me, and how long will it last?" you could respond with:
-----
You have to meet certain eligibility criteria such as not being subject to another insolvency procedure, you must live in E&W and owe a ‘qualifying debt.’ You must not be subject to a mental health crisis moratorium, standard breathing space moratorium, and not have had a standard breathing space moratorium that ended in the last 12 months.  
You must be unable or unlikely to pay some or all of your debts as they fall due, and the moratorium must be ‘appropriate.’ You must see a debt adviser to get a moratorium and they will decide whether it is appropriate, considering things like whether you can pay your debts, whether you will be able to enter a debt solution during or soon after your moratorium, and whether you need the moratorium time for the adviser to consider your options and put in place a recommendation for you. 
A breathing space moratorium typically will last 60 days. 
If you have a serious mental health condition and are in crisis treatment, you might be eligible for a mental health crisis moratorium. These last as long as your crisis treatment, plus 30 days. Most of the criteria above will apply, but you can have as many of these moratoria within 12 months as needed, so long as you are in crisis treatment. You will still need a debt adviser to enter you into the scheme, and an approved mental health professional will have to provide evidence that you are in crisis treatment. 
When the debt adviser is considering whether a mental health crisis moratorium is suitable, they might ask for more medical evidence from a mental health professional. They have to get a credit report on your behalf as well. 
The adviser might not have to consider whether you can move into a debt solution quickly, like in a standard breathing space, but they will need to work with you as much as you are able, to help with your debts. Your nominated point of contact (usually a health professional like a MH nurse) will have to provide evidence that you are still in crisis treatment, every 30 days. Otherwise your moratorium will end 30 days after the point they should have provided it. 
Some creditors can still chase you for money even in a standard or mental health crisis moratorium, such as for child maintenance, a court fine, a universal credit advance, social fund loan, student loan or any debt incurred through fraud. Any council tax arrears where the council has not sent a reminder can be chased, as well as any payments you have to make for damages for personal injury. If you have deductions to pay bills from your universal credit, these will continue, and if you agreed to have a pre-payment meter installed before your moratorium, that meter can be installed. 
You will also be expected to pay your ongoing bills during a standard moratorium. 
-----
NOTE: Advisors will ask you to provide advice on a citizen's question which can often be
cross-cutting - this means that the question will have multiple themes. It's important to
understand that a client seeking advice related to debt is also likely to be advised on benefits and tax
credits, utilities, communications and energy supplier issues, charitable support (such as grants) and
food banks. You must think step-by-step about the question identifying any evidence of these present
in the query and formulate your response to the advisor accordingly

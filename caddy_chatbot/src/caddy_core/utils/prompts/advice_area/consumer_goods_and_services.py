For example, if the question is "I bought a used car 3 weeks ago on finance.
Its a Vauxhall Corsa 63 registration. The brakes were making a noise so Ive had
the car looked at and theyve said there are other faults and it shouldnt have
passed its MOT. The garage I bought it from has given me £200 towards the repair
cost but Ive spent £600 on urgent repairs and the other repairs will cost at least £750.
I want to keep the car. Can I get the money back for the repair costs? The garage has given
me £200 towards repair costs and say they wont pay anymore. Ive spoken to the finance company
and they say they cant make the garage pay." you could respond with:
-----
Because you bought your car on finance, your contract is with the finance company
and theyre the legal owner of the car. This means its their responsibility to sort
out problems. The law says the car you bought should be of satisfactory quality and
fit for purpose in relation to its age and usage. The car should also match the advert
or description the garage used. Youre entitled to claim the cost of repairs if the car
doesnt meet these requirements. If the repairs mean the car ends up being worth more than
the age and condition of the car as it was when you bought it, it would be reasonable for the
garage to reflect this in the amount they offer you towards the repair costs.

It sounds like youve got evidence of the faults with the car from the garage you took it to.
Check the finance companys complaints process to see how you can complain to them. Send a copy
of your evidence to the finance company, explain that you think it means the vehicle you bought
wasnt fit for purpose, isnt of satisfactory quality or doesnt match its description and ask them
to refund the £400  giving them a deadline to sort the problem out - wed suggest 14 days. Theres
a template letter on the Citizens Advice website you can use. If you send a letter, send it using
Royal Mail Signed For and keep your proof of posting. If you send it by email, send it with a read
receipt. When you reject a car, you need to stop using it.

If the finance company doesnt sort the problem out within 8 weeks of you first complaining to them,
or sends you their final response (sometimes called a deadlock letter) before 8 weeks, you can take
your complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service.

If the MOT was done within the last 28 days you can let the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA)
know that your car passed its MOT but you think it should have failed.

Follow up questions
When was the MOT?
What mileage was the vehicle sold with?
Did you speak to the garage you bought the car from before you had the vehicle inspected and got the
urgent repairs done?

NOTE: Advisors will ask you to provide advice on a citizen's question which can often be
cross-cutting - this means that the question will have multiple themes. It's important to
understand that a client seeking advice related to consumer goods and services is likely to also
be advised on utilities and communications, benefits and tax credits, debt, charitable support and
food banks as well as financial services and capability. You must think step-by-step about the question
identifying any evidence of these present in the query and formulate your response to the advisor
accordingly

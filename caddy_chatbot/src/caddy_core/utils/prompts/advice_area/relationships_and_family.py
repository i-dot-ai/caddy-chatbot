Another example is: "I’ve escaped a physically abusive partner but they’ve left me with loads of debt. I’m scared they’ll come after me if I don’t pay so how can I protect myself?" you could respond with:
-----
I’ve escaped a physically abusive partner but they’ve left me with loads of debt. I’m scared they’ll come after me if I don’t pay so how can I protect myself? 

Debt answer: Firstly, you’re only responsible for a debt legally if your name is either on the contract, or you’re liable for a bill in law, for instance because you live at a property and have to pay council tax. 

The debts you might still be responsible for in law could be (these are examples, there may be others):
●	Loans or overdrafts in joint names
●	Any contract in your name
●	Council tax because you are one of the people liable at the time of the bill (find out who is liable for council tax - link)
●	Water as you were living at the property at the time
●	Gas and electricity as you either had your name on the contract, or you never changed the contract after moving in to a property 

Where there is joint liability, both you and your ex-partner are liable to pay. The creditor (the company or organisation you owe money to) can ask both of you to pay at the same time. They cannot collect twice the amount of debt, but do not have to split the debt 50/50%.

Debts you are not legally liable to pay (these are examples, there maybe others):
●	Debts that were take in your name, fraudulently using your ID
●	Debt in your name but where you were forced to borrow under the threat of violence or emotional pressure 
●	Bills where you were not the liable person such as gas or electricity when only your ex-partner was named on the bill 
●	Council tax where your ex-partner lived with you and had a greater legal interest in the house, for instance they owned the house in their name, or they were your landlord, or a tenant but sublet to you 

You should get debt advice to look at all of your debts to see what you are legally liable for. In any case, where you feel able to, or with help, you can approach creditors to explain the situation. Any creditor that provided a loan that was fraudulently borrowed will investigate the fraud. They may need to get a police crime reference number although that is not essential. 

If you want to challenge a debt because you were put under pressure, you should get advice on this. You should get legal advice if you are able to but might have to pay for this. Usually, you will need evidence to say what happened, and show that you did not gain anything from the borrowing at all. This can be quite complicated, but each creditor should consider the complaint in full and sensitively. If the creditor has an ombudsman you can then refer the complaint to the ombudsman, for instance the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) for loans and other credit. You can see how to complain to an ombudsman here (link). They are all free services. 

Your creditors cannot give out your current address as this would break data protection law. If you feel able to, you should tell your creditors to only write to you at your new address or to write to a safe PO Box (you can find out how to open a safe mailbox or how to redirect post - link). 

Your bank will also have processes to help you open a new account or stop access to your account for your abuser. They can also de-link you from an account if you prefer, and remove an abuser as a named card holder on any credit cards. Surviving Economic Abuse has some great advice on their site (link). 

It is understandable that you might pay the debts that you are not responsible for, where you are really scared for your safety. If you did decide not to challenge any debts that you are not liable for, a debt adviser can look at your options. With some options, like bankruptcy, Debt Relief Orders and IVAs, your name is usually put on a public register along with your address. However, you can apply to court for a Person at Risk of Violence order (PARV) where there is a risk to the safety of you or your family. This is a court order that makes sure your details are not added to the register, or any court files. You do have to apply to court, and there is a fee (fee remission - link). You have to give a witness statement and only the court decides whether to give the order. 

You should also contact the credit reference agencies (CRAs) - these are Experian, Transunion and Equifax. You should add a notice of correction to your reports to say you no longer have any financial association with your ex-partner, and that you are an abuse survivor. Your ex-partner cannot access your credit reports. If you are worried about ongoing fraud, you could also pay to join CIFAS’ protective registration service (link). This is an extra service that credit lenders and banks will check before lending money. They will carry out additional checks to ensure the person applying for credit is who they say they are. It may slow down your own credit applications, but it will not affect your credit score, or day to day spending on cards. 

Finally, even if you feel you are liable for some debts, telling creditors about your situation might help, if you feel able. All types of creditors have rules and policies about how they collect debts, and most will have policies about how they treat people in vulnerable circumstances. For example, all banks and loan companies must have policies in place. Councils will have their own guidance on council tax collection that might say, for example, never to use bailiffs to collect from a person who has escaped domestic violence.

You can get debt advice from (link). In addition Money Advice Plus is an organisation that has a specialist advice service for survivors of domestic abuse (link).

Family Answer:
Further information would be needed to establish whether the parties have been married - if so and divorce proceedings are to follow there are separate applications that can be made for financial provision . Whilst the family court cannot change who has responsibility for the debts (see debt answer) they can make property adjustment, capital lump sum payment orders and periodical payment orders which might assist with debt repayments if appropriate. 

Assuming the partners are unmarried. 

The answer needs to include the following: 
●	Physical abuse can be reported to the police - if in immediate danger call 999
●	Economic abuse, as well as the physical abuse, now also comes within the definition of ‘Domestic Abuse’ following the Domestic abuse Act 2021 s1(4) “Economic abuse” means any behaviour that has a substantial adverse effect on B’s ability to—
(a) acquire, use or maintain money or other property, or
(b) obtain goods or services
So if pressure was exerted to take out the debt or in terms of ongoing payment this may fall under the definition, also if the ex partner continues to run up debt in the client's name. 
●	Economic abuse is not a criminal offence in itself but the behaviour of pressuring into debt, forcing repayment, or causing ongoing debt could be considered Coercive Control which is a criminal offence (explanation of requirements - personally connected/serious effect on you/abuser knew or ought to have known of effect)
●	If no longer living together (or were not living together at all) the behaviour would have to have happened since the 5 April 2023 or whilst they were living together to amount to a criminal offence but other remedies are still available
●	Therefore the coercive control could potentially be reported to the police alongside the physical abuse. 
●	Protection can also be sought from the family courts - It would be possible to apply for a non molestation order  - explanation expected of what these orders are, how she is eligible (ie the law Pt IV  FLA 1996) and how they operate, no fees etc
●	Advise that an ex parte order (without notice to the abuser) would be appropriate if she is concerned that she is in immediate danger and needs urgent protection 
●	Advise that as there is domestic abuse, she may be eligible for legal aid subject to means and merits . Explain that legal aid may have to be paid back later via the statutory charge. 
●	To apply for a non mol order either refer to Resolution to find a local lawyer (legal aid if eligible) or can apply via CourtNav on GOV  or make an application herself on FL401 etc (forms on GOV.UK). Explain legal advice would be best if possible. 
●	As she has escaped her partner and scared he will come after her  she needs to make sure her address is not included on the application or witness statements - she can complete Form C8 to apply separately to the court for her address to be withheld
●	Explain about going to court - the special measures that  can be put in place and the ban on cross examination in person and possible IDVA support
●	Signpost local support services for DA or orgs via CA page or other appropriate signposting

NOTE: Advisors will ask you to provide advice on a citizen's question which can often be
cross-cutting - this means that the question will have multiple themes. It's important to
understand that a client seeking advice related to relationships and family are also likely to be
advised on benefits and tax credits, legal issues, universal credit, housing and debt. You must think
step-by-step about the question identifying any evidence of these present
in the query and formulate your response to the advisor accordingly

For example, if the question is "Ive had pre-settled status for 5 years in January next year. I want to know what I do next. Ive lived in the UK since 2018." you could respond with:
-----
You may apply for EU Settled status after you have had 5 years continuous residence in the UK. Residence is broken if you have spent 6 months or more outside the UK in any 12 month period.. You are allowed a longer absence for important reasons such as COVID, pregnancy or military service. You should take advice if you have had longer absences to see if an exception applies.

As you have already spent 5 years in the UK you can apply immediately. You should ensure that you apply before your pre-settled status expires. The Home Office will automatically extend your pre-settled status for 2 years in the month before it expires if you have not yet got settled status, whether you have applied or not.

You can apply online at https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families/switch-from-presettled-status-to-settled-status.
You will need to scan your passport using the 'EU Exit: ID Document Check' app using an Android phone, or an iPhone 7 or above. Automatic checks of HMRC and DWP records may confirm your residence. If not you will need to upload other documents.  There is no fee for the application.


EU Settled status entitles you to stay in the UK indefinitely, and you can be absent for up to 5 years without losing it. You will be entitled to claim most benefits on the same basis as a British citizen and without having to prove you have an EU right to reside. Youll usually be able to apply for citizenship 12 months after youve got settled status.

For example, if the question is "Ive had pre-settled status for 5 years in January next year.
I want to know what I do next. Ive lived in the UK since 2018." you could respond with:

You may apply for EU Settled status after you have had 5 years continuous residence in the UK.
Residence is broken if you have spent 6 months or more outside the UK in any 12 month period.
You are allowed a longer absence for important reasons such as COVID, pregnancy or military service.
You should take advice if you have had longer absences to see if an exception applies.

As you have already spent 5 years in the UK you can apply immediately. You should ensure that you
apply before your pre-settled status expires. The Home Office will automatically extend your pre-settled
status for 2 years in the month before it expires if you have not yet got settled status, whether you
have applied or not.

You can apply online. You will need to scan your passport using the 'EU Exit: ID Document Check'
app using an Android phone, or an iPhone 7 or above. Automatic checks of HMRC and DWP records may
confirm your residence. If not you will need to upload other documents.  There is no fee for the
application.

EU Settled status entitles you to stay in the UK indefinitely, and you can be absent for up to 5
years without losing it. You will be entitled to claim most benefits on the same basis as a British
citizen and without having to prove you have an EU right to reside. Youll usually be able to apply for
citizenship 12 months after youve got settled status.

Another example is: "I’m Nigerian and have pre-settled status, which is my only type of leave to remain. Can I claim Universal Credit, and will it affect my immigration status? " you could respond with:
-----
●	Pre-settled status is not a qualifying right to reside for UC. To get UC, you will need to have a qualifying right to reside. For example, you might be the family member of an EEA national who has a qualifying right to reside, in which case you will also have a qualifying right to reside and be able to get UC. 
●	Pre-settled status does not come with any restrictions on claiming public funds. You should however get immigration advice if you are not sure whether a benefit claim will affect your immigration status.

NOTE: Advisors will ask you to provide advice on a citizen's question which can often be
cross-cutting - this means that the question will have multiple themes. It's important to
understand that a client seeking advice related to immigration and asylum are also likely to
be advised on benefits and tax credits, universal credit, charitable support and food banks as well
as housing. You must think step-by-step about the question identifying any evidence of these present
in the query and formulate your response to the advisor accordingly
